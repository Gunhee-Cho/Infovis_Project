1,"A fun, challenging (at times), Pokemon game with an addictive gameplay loop and an interesting system of fighting and catching Pokemon. It's a huge step in the right direction! The graphics, performance, and multiplayer options need work, but those are the only major flaws. The story, pacing, battles, catching mechanics, exploration, and general gameplay are such an improvement over Sword/Shield and Sun/Moon.There are major series changes that make big differences in quality of life, such as no limit to the number of moves a Pokemon can learn (they just have 4 memorized pre-battles) and not having to trade to evolve certain Pokemon anymore (using rare items on them instead). Exploration, crafting, gathering, and finding rare (and shiny) Pokemon have never been this fun. Gone is much of the tedium and boredom found in previous games.If you care only about graphics or online competitive battles, you will find reasons to not like this game. But if you're into the collecting aspect of Pokemon, you will love this. It's worth noting that the graphics and performance issues are much less noticeable when playing handheld.",30-Jan-22,10,0.722222222,60,111,5.8
2,El juego mÃ¡s infravalorado de la saga y posiblemente el mejor de todos. Nintendo y GF lo han vuelto a hacer aÃ±os despuÃ©s. BRAVO.,29-Jan-22,10,0.774193548,8,12,7.2

4,"One outstanding experience, that is certain. I absolutely love the direction GameFreak is going for with this whole new installment for the Pokemon series, and it is very refreshing, while being very needed at the same time. Catching Pokemon in this game is more fun than ever, and I'm a fan since the first era with the FireRed/LeafGreen versions. It's way more than a nostalgia trip : it is a brand new experience and I sincerely do hope that we will see a bigger sequel to it because the game really deserves one with further gameplay enhancements, maybe a bigger map with more activities. Cheers to all the haters! ;)",03-Feb-22,10,0.5,1,14,9
5,"Incredible game that moves the Pokemon series forward in a fresh new direction. The gameplay loop is fun, and while the graphics aren't great, they are more than fine. Gameplay should always take precedent over graphics, and Legends: Arceus is a joy to play!",29-Jan-22,10,0.724637681,5,6,8
6,"Im so addicted! New mechanics and ideas are really fantastic! Can?t stop playing it! Over 40 hrs and still can?t put down the console! The world is really beautifull, exploration is truly amazing. The only grip is the performance and graphics but the game has it own graphical moments. Must play for sure!",05-Feb-22,10,0.6,2,364,6.6

8,"A delight to play this game, perfect evolution of the saga with a magnificent exploration, completing the pokedex is very satisfying unlike in traditional pokemon that was more of a nuisance than anything else, graphically it is not bad at all but that is the least important, it's fun, it's addictive. Enjoy!",20-Feb-22,10,0,9,17,7.2

10,"I'll get this out of the way, the graphics is the only thing imho that needs polish, but they are still servicable. I been playing the game for over 10 hours and honestly most fun I had in years with a Pokemon game. This game is testing grounds for future Pokemon games in this style. So let's put the graphics aside for a moment and look at the bigger picture here. Aside from Graphics do you want more. Pokemon games like this? I sure do, that's why despite the graphics needing more, that this game deserves a 10.",29-Jan-22,10,0.763888889,11,143,10

13,"A game with terrible graphics and technical issues but extremely fun and addictive gameplay. This is the right direction for PokÃ©mon! It?s so much more enjoyable than the boring exploration and battles of Sw/Sh and S/M. Exploring, crafting, discovering new PokÃ©mon. It?s a blast. Also the 0/10 reviews are from people who obviously didn?t even bother playing the game and are just hating on it because it looked bad in the trailers and they don?t like to be wrong.",29-Jan-22,10,0.8,2,6,10
14,"Overall, this game is a breath of fresh air. It brings new elements and life to a system that has otherwise overstayed its welcome for the last few decades. I genuinely hope they keep this fusion of RPG/turn based system for Pokemon games to follow as it allowed the player actual choice and actual exploration that felt rewarding to me. Whether that be in the form of finding rare items or pokemon spawns, I never felt it was pointless to actually touch every corner of the admittedly large segmented areas.As for player choice, there were many times I had a marker on the map which indicated where I needed to go to progress the story which I just ignored. You can explore, catch, and train pokemon at your own pace which as most Pokemon fans know, isn't the norm. You can find rare items, pokemon, alpha pokemon, and everything else freely from your second time stepping into the fields which was really nice. Ontop of that, there are multiple ways to completed your pokedex. You can battle, you can capture, you can observe, or you can raise them yourself and learn things about them. You'll see a lot of people on here saying it felt tedious, but they had options. They just didn't explore them or take the time to read them.Of course there is a graphical downside, but I honestly never felt like it hindered my experience throughout my play through. It is an area they need to work on though going forward.Without going too much into it since I want this to be a spoiler free review, this game is amazing. I can't understand people who are trying to say this is the worse Pokemon game to ever exist. It is far from the worse and easily ranks as one of the best imo. I really hope they intend to keep this formula, because I don't know if I can revert to the old system in Gen9 after experiencing this. This is a fun game and if you actually read into the mechanics and into the side quest, they give you a fun idea of the NPCs take on the world, your character, and many other aspects.A lot of fun Easter Eggs are in the game too, so keep your eyes peeled for those!",29-Jan-22,10,0.779661017,11,12,9.4

17,"I have played literally every PokÃ©mon game over the last years. I still remember sitting in the car as my parents got me and my sister a Gameboy Color and a game for each of us, Pokemon Red for my sister, Pokemon Blue for me. I always had my rival growing up, trying to catch more, train harder, just over all be the better PokÃ©mon trainer than my sister. She filled her Dex before me, but I had the first lvl 100 PokÃ©mon.I?m older now, internet has definitely impacted my personal connection to the PokÃ©mon franchise because it made me feel less connected to individuals, but PokÃ©mon Legends Arceus brought the personal connection to PokÃ©mon I?ve missed for so long over the years. Yes, I love the old mechanics, but after 20 years of them I do think it is time for a fresh start, and Arceus did just that.I see this game as Gen 1 of a whole new PokÃ©mon experience, and in so I feel like this game is to be more fairly compared to PokÃ©mon Yellow.I?ll first touch on Multiplayer, since I see most complaining on the lack of multiplayer, but this game is not a game meant to have all the fancy online features that take away the truest soul and heart of PokÃ©mon, the reason we all attached to the original games. It was the connection we had with our PokÃ©mon and trading PokÃ©mon. That feeling you get when a companion you worked hard on leaves your party, you feel it. Battles will be coming, but they need to build the world for us first.Arceus needs to be seen as a foundation for what can come, and I truly believe Gamefreak sees it the same way. Think about it, the game starts off with us being sent into the past, before Gyms, before PokÃ©mon centers, before even people and PokÃ©mon achieved harmony. The world isn?t empty, it?s just fertile and ready for a civilization to be established. Jublife City is just the start.Mechanic wise, this game revolutionized how to play PokÃ©mon. Being able to run and throwing out your PokÃ©mon left and right to gather material, cycling through them as you get in a rhythm and collecting even faster because you have your PokÃ©mon helping. Getting caught by a PokÃ©mon and throwing out yours just so you can actually run away a good distance away from the PokÃ©mon attacking you(no more hitting Run Away button for me!), throwing all six of your PokÃ©mon out so they can interact with each other, or even running into the toward the enemy PokÃ©mon as you tell your PokÃ©mon to attack. The mechanics let you interact with your PokÃ©mon in so many ways. My rating is technically 9.5 for this game. But it?s a damn good start for the next generation of PokÃ©mon.",30-Jan-22,10,0.78125,3,3,0
18,The Pokemon game I've been waiting for since I first watched the anime as a kid.Visuals are a little lacking but everything else is amazing.8/10 inflated to battle the trolls.,30-Jan-22,10,0.825,5,8,5.3
19,"Pokemon Leyendas: Arceus es un juegazo, grÃ¡ficamente es normal, pero lo que es en el resto de apartados, simplemente lo hace ser uno de los mejores juegos, te atrapa de una manera descontrolada, no es repetitivo como alguno creerÃ¡n, la historia es buena (si quieren historias mejores, cÃ³mprense pelijuegos o directamente vayan al cine) el cambio en la jugabilidad y el sistema de combate lo hace mÃ¡s dinÃ¡mico y fluido, que te ataquen los pkmns, le da un toque de dificultad nuevo, que haya contenido recortado, se entiende, porque es una Ã©poca pasada, lo de la distorsiÃ³n simplemente es un aÃ±adido muy divertido, pelear y capturar con pkmns alfa es otra inclusiÃ³n muy buena.

22,"This is a new masterpiece brought to the pokemon community. I'll try to go over the positive elements and things to improve on. I'll also try to make it free of spoilers too.""But things to improve on? You've rated this game 10 and it has things to work on?"" Sure do! I'm rating a game based on the fun I'm having, and the urge to continue playing, and both those things are over the roof. I'm having a blast, and the people around me who bought it too seems to be in the same place. So this is totally worth a 10 in my opinion.Am I giving this a 10 just because it is pokemon? Absolutely not. Pokemon in the last few years has been hard to finish, in the sense of getting boring before you get to the good part ( The end game)Lets start with the positives:- Catching mecanics are really fun, using items to lure in, stun, scare pokemon while having new pokeballs that play with distance and surprise is a blast. Even if I have every pokemon in my pokemon Home up to this game, I'm enjoying catching everything I see for the first time in years. Trying to catch a pokemon by surprise is also really rewarding and fun.- Overworld use of pokemon: Being able to chose which pokemon to throw in at any time is really interresting. Like preparing the right pokeball in case something goes wrong when catching, or knowing a pokemon of a certain type is hidden somewhere and using the best pokemon to uncover it.- Crafting and in game economy is meaningful, the world is full of resources to look for and the money has its uses so you don't hoard it ( Pokemon has been giving too much to players in the last few games, to the point where it's hard to spend it all)- Pokedex feels like you're really working on it, as it is not filling itslef on its own with just 1 encounter. While a good portion of it just fills itslef while playing normally, I often stop to check on the pokemon in front of me to see if I can work on something. The pokedex progression is also the game progression and it really feels like a fun goal to work on.- Combat: Some base elements makes it more refreshing, like status effect for example, none of them last forever anymore, but they have some other effects, like the new sleep: drowsy, that makes the pokemon receive more damage. This makes such moves more interresting. In the previous game I was running around with a thunderwave pokemon and catching most of my stuff with that. The strong and agile style are interresting combined with the combat timeline. It's refreshing while staying close to tradition.- IVs/EVs: are gone. replaced by a new system that is simpler. Although I didn't mind the old system, it was a bit tedious and getting redundant for me, so I welcome the change here.- Breeding, while at first I was shocked that it was removed, was a boring portion of the game in my opinion. While I wouldnt mind having it back with a bit of rework, I feel the game is better without it for this iteration.- Alpha pokemon, really fun little challenges to catch these everywhere. Love it.- Shiny hunting is now fun in this game, gosh, it's weird to say that...Things to work on:- The story, while it is a good story for Pokemon (I'm not feeling bored like previous recent games) but I'm not feeling like I want to rush to know what's next. Maybe it is for the better though because I've taken my merry time to explore and experience the world and THAT is fun- Competitive: They really need to bring battle between players in the future, it feels off to not have that option and it a fun part of the endgame to build a good team to battle.- Graphics: I'm not sure why so many people complain here, the graphics are ok, even if not on par with games like breath of the wild, they are still ok. Pokemon has never been praised for its graphics... The lightning seems off in some places or when it rains, but other than that, it's totally fine.- Battle with noble pokemon. While I do like the general idea and I'm having fun during these battles, its a little offsetting to throw food into a pokemon's face to calm it down. Like hell I would calm down if you threw me my favorite food in the face... The idea is fun to play, but weird as a concept.- Inventory: I don't mind moving things to storage and managing my inventory, but surely some things can be done to help that process... same for pokemon ""boxes"" I guess. I feel I miss a couple things to improve the usage of both of these.",02-Feb-22,10,0.785714286,2,2,0

25,"I was really dissapointed with every mainline Pokemon game on Switch so far. Let's Go and BDSP were inferior versions of FRLG/Platinum imo and SwSh really lacked when it came to exploring and content over all. Therefore I can't believe it that GameFreak finally did it again, they finally made an awesome Pokemon game again. The new catching mechanics, huge areas to explore, an interesting story (in terms of a Pokemon game), a lot of side stuff to do etc. Now that's what I call a next level Pokemon game. Graphics could be better but they aren't bad either, up close they can look really nice but it's the draw/render distance that could be better.Overall it's the best Pokemon game since ORAS imo and every Pokemon should definitely pick this game up, you won't regret it",01-Feb-22,10,0.916666667,24,71,6.4

32,"I would guess most people that are rating it low for graphics haven?t played the game. Is it unreal engine 5? No, but it has its own stylization, charm, and the visuals are not nearly as bad as some people are claiming. Ground textures could be better, but other visuals are also quite attractive. The changes the game brings, the stunning and clean UI, sounds, music, maps, and unique story all excel so far. I know Game Freak and The Pokemon company probably have the money to hire the best of the best, but maybe they don?t want to do that and support/grow the teams they already have. If this is a giant leap forward for the innovation of PokÃ©mon games, I can imagine the future will only get better.Decide for yourself, watch streams if you need a better place to form your own opinion, and be open to different gaming experiences. 4K hyper realism doesn?t need to be the standard for every AAA game.",29-Jan-22,10,0.830188679,3,3,0

40,"Where to start... Yes, I get why people don't like this game because of the graphics. However, for someone like me, that has grown up with Pokemon Red in the early days. It's a 7 year old child dream come true. I love this game so much. When I played it, I feel 7 years again playing Pokemon Red for the first time on my Gameboy Colour. Nostagic aside, the gameplay is super fun! Everything feels so smooth, running, throwing a Pokeball to a Shinx and immediatly after that catching another one. Its so addicitive and fun to play. I am only in the first area and spend 15 hours already! For people that not like this game. Ask yourself the question. Are you really a Pokemon fan? Because I don't get why you can hate this game graphics aside. Gamefreak finally shake some things up. And hopefully, they going to improve this concept further with more gameplay options and much better graphics. I am going back to filling my Pokedex! ;-)",01-Feb-22,10,0.833333333,7,11,7.2

A giant leap forward and makes what ever game comes next, already top of my to watch out for list.

47,"PokÃ©mon has had a rough transition to 3D. Between the games getting easier to the point of being braindead, the fact that routes feel less like places to explore and more like corridors with occasional wild PokÃ©mon battles, and the designs that keep getting worse and worse with each new generation, the cracks in the seams became a lot more noticeable. This reached its peak when the series made its proper jump to the Nintendo Switch with PokÃ©mon Sword and PokÃ©mon Shield, directed by Shigeru Ohmori, cutting about half of the PokÃ©dex only to sell it back to you later down the line, and just generally looking like an upscaled 3DS game. And then we get the long awaited Sinnoh remakes with PokÃ©mon Brilliant Diamond and PokÃ©mon Shining Pearl, directed by Junichi Masuda, only if you wanted a Sinnoh remake that actually improved on Gen 4's foundation, you're never going to get one until modding gets more advanced.So, with Ohmori most likely working on Gen 9 and Masuda attempting to polish up BDSP, enter Kazumasa Iwao, director of PokÃ©mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, the first game in the 3D era to actually feel like a game. And I think it's safe to say that if anyone needs to be the director of future PokÃ©mon games, it needs to be Iwao, as Ohmori and Masuda are holding the series back. This was the big jump that PokÃ©mon needed, and I'd say it delivers. Yeah, the visuals aren't that great, and the game can either feel grindy, or like a collectathon, but with every PokÃ©mon you catch, you're making progress through the game. I'm currently about to start the 5th area, and the only reason I didn't make this review sooner is that the game is too much fun. This game could very well shape up the future of PokÃ©mon, so do you want more visual novels with occasional monster catching elements, or actual games to sink your time into?

Como es un juego que te incita a la exploraciÃ³n, se contradice un poco en ese sentido.

There's SO MANY side quests!! It feels I could keep going and going forever and always have something to do. The new battle mechanics are incredible, the most fun PokÃ©mon battles have ever been, what a shame there aren't more battles tbh. The game is also quite hard, found my PokÃ©mon fainting a lot. But not hard to the point where it's unplayable or annoying, it's just the right amount of balance between easy and difficult. You can comfortable play it, let's put it that way. Seeing the PokÃ©mon in their natural habitat is so refreshing, feels like a playable version of PokÃ©mon Snap.The gameplay is fun, the story is original, the characters have charisma, the customization options are great (more unlock whilst you progress in the game), the crafting is cool, and, even though the graphical aspect isn't the best admittedly... it honestly does NOT take away from the gameplay at all. It is just that fun. At no point did I feel like the graphics were worsening my experience. And since the artstyle is beautiful, you don't even feel like the game is ugly. But yeah, considering it was never a bother, I don't even want to lower the score because of it. So far, it's the only flaw I have found.If you're a PokÃ©mon fan, you will love this.

None of this helped them because the game turned out to be the opposite of the malicious prejudices that were being formed:-Well-made gameplay that meets in being fun.-Objectives and missions not are repetitive at all-Excelent music-Good story-Good difficulty curve-Good artThere are many things that Arceus Legends do well.",29-Jan-22,10,0.796610169,6,14,6.6

168,"[SPOILER FREE REVIEW]Overall this game is pretty good. Even though the graphics and textures are not the best they're still okay. On the other hand, they put A LOT of effort into the characters models, pokÃ©mon and animations in general. The gameplay mechanics are also really refreshing compared to the predecessors and the story doesn't follow the typical PokÃ©mon formula [Evil enemy team, get all badges & beat the champion]. I barely encountered any bugs and even when I encountered one it wasn't anything game-breaking and it didn't disturb that much. All in all, I enjoy this game a lot especially because my expectations weren't that high, so I was really surprised when the game turned out to be good. Important to know is that Gamefreak barely made any games that weren't top-down perspective before, so it definitely lacks some depth in terms of world design but that will definitely get better, the more games they make in this kind of style. It's really hard to change a whole developers studio workflow. Just like the old pokÃ©mon games the graphics will probably get better from game to game.About myself: The only PokÃ©mon Games I've played were Firered, Let's go and Sword/Shield because I'm mainly a PC gamer. I know that there are things missing from old PokÃ©mon games but from a non-biased non-nostalgic perspective, it's definitely an enjoyable gameplay experience.",29-Jan-22,10,0.757142857,2,2,0

Since the series' gradual decline into stagnation and mediocrity starting with Black & White, it felt like there was no hope for PokÃ©mon games to be good again, each title was getting worse and worse. Then comes Legends: Arceus, a brand new spin on the tired and overdone PokÃ©mon formula, with a world that actually feels open and alive and gameplay that doesn't bore you to death. Legends: Arceus also brings a plethora of actual QOL changes to the franchise that Masuda and Ohmori were hesitant to bring, such as being able to learn moves whenever you want, and completely reworking the terrible, bloated EV/IV/Nature system that Ruby & Sapphire introduced. Kazumasa Iwao is the kind of person that needs to be in charge of the main series PokÃ©mon games from now on.

203,"I really liked it, it may not be a graphic masterpiece but it's a lot of fun, the changes are positive, and because they are positive, they tend to stay and be improved in the future. Do not take seriously the opinion of those who have not played and simply say that it is not worth it because of the graphics (you can be sure that if someone said that the game is not good because of the graphics that person did not play). Go play and see how fun the game isIt's an important step for franchising. They've been trying to evolve a 25 year series and they're on the right track, thinking so Pokemon Legends Arceus can almost be called a successful draft. I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the franchise, who doesn't play pokemon and doesn't have the weight of nostalgia probably won't be enchanted by the game.",29-Jan-22,10,0.850746269,1,1,0
204,"This game demands improvements, and it is not perfect. However, what it is is a game filled with wonder, exploration, and fun. A hope for future entries to build on top of the foundation that is Pokemon Legends: Arceus and join other A-list Nintendo games such as Breath of the Wild, Metroid Dread, Xenoblade 2, and so on. PLA steals my attention with its smooth and seamless gameplay, numerous side missions and monsters to tame, absolutely GORGEOUS music, along with a difficulty curve that is refreshing for long time players seeking a challenge. Alpha Pokemon are especially fun and quite the challenge, and had me going, ""oh **** oh **** oh ****!"" the first time I ran into one. Graphics are.. lacking, sure, but not nearly as bad as some may say; in fact, some areas are beautiful enough to be worthy of a screenshot. The art direction is reminiscent of ancient Japanese ink paintings (which I believe was deliberate considering the era in which PLA takes place).. anyone who has played Okami will surely recognize this style. This is a game that can prove to deniers that graphics are not solely what makes a gaming experience great or special. I am 15 hours in and still without facing the first noble, and have not felt any inkling of boredom in the slightest. I can easily see myself spending many hours exploring and discovering.

206,"PokÃ©mon Legends: Arceus manages to re-work the stale formula of the mainline PokÃ©mon series which hasn't been well received in nearly two decades. The game finds a way to blend more PokÃ©mon Go-esc mechanics with the traditional PokÃ©mon battle system almost seamlessly into open environments to the point where I never got tired of trying to catch everything I could find.Unfortunately, the game does have to make some sacrifices to allow for its likely short development time due to the PokÃ©mon Company's eagerness to get games out quickly. This is most apparent when judging the game from a graphical perspective which, for a game that feels like it should like nice due to its attempts at BOTW-esc environments, it absolutely fails... look at it more as if BOTW were for the Wii (although do keep in mind that footage of the game likely looks far worse than the game itself since for example Youtube compression hardcore messes up the grass) . Additionally, there are only about 240 or so PokÃ©mon which is seems a little disappointing but considering they actually gave them new animations and worked them into the game's world that much more would just feel impossible to implement in only a few years.Regardless of its flaws, the game still comes out to be a ton of fun with its new gameplay loop and intriguing story and still earns a high rating in my book.",29-Jan-22,10,0.846153846,1,1,0

212,"What an amazing game, the gameplay is just so fluid, it is the first pokemon game that makes you want to complete the pokedex. This game is a wonderful step forward to this franchise, the difficulty level is just perfect, you can get over-levelled, but the wild pokemon constantly tag team you, making it a 2v1 or maybe a 3v1.The greatest flaw of this game is its graphics, some textures are actually really ugly, the moves are actually pretty beautiful, but sometimes the trees, or even the pokemon are not that good looking. Besides, the fps constantly decreases, but not in a way that bothers you a lot.Since the game changes a lot the core mechanics, this game is easily the most noob-friendly game of the franchise, making the player learn about pokemon as they play.Overall, pokemon legends arceus is a fantastic game with fantastic mechanics, it's the closest we ever got to the dream pokemon game. It's not a 10/10 because we know the graphics can be better, but every single aspect of this game makes me want to play it even more.Update: What a fantastic ending arc, now this game is indeed a 10/10",29-Jan-22,10,0.844827586,1,1,0

It's story elements is very well mixed into gameplay and while the game is not on par with the likes of Fable or Skyrim as RPGs, it is still a fun experience and a definitive step in the right direction. If you haven't tried Pokemon yet, this is the game to try. If you are a long-time fan of the series like myself, you'll feel a sense of astonishment that a Pokemon game can actually be enjoyable.

Could change again, not entirely sure.) I'm enjoying it a lot. 20 hours in so far. Here are the ""highlights for me so far.* Although it's not going to win any awards, the story is the best a Pokemon game has done in a long time.* Catching mechanic is amazing. No more going into a battle to weaken them and then throw a pokeball. Just hide, toss, wait, and repeat if necessary. There are some limits and exceptions though.* There's something very satisfying running across a Pokemon you didn't know was in the game or that is a rare spawn. Pikachu, Eevee, Chimchar, etc are all available in the first area.* You can choose when to evolve your pokemon once they have met the requirements.* You can switch out moves anywhere at any time as long as the pokemon knows them. No more forgetting moves and having to reteach them if you mess up.* ""Boss"" Encounters are fun and challenging at times. Although, you're not gonna lose anything if you die.* A specific mechanic (no spoilers) that opens up mid story is VERY challenging if you want to go after them for the rare items and spawns.* Alpha Pokemon are very fun to fight and catch. They have the highest AI in the game and are actually smart. lol* Personally I like the graphical style they chose. Again, not going to win any awards but I like it.",31-Jan-22,10,0.875,1,1,0

280,"Gamefreak's first big deviation from a very successful formula, while still utilizing the parts that made Pokemon so great.Graphics: not stunning but they do not detract from the experience.Gameplay: The flow between battle and open world is seamless. No more waiting 10 seconds everytime you encounter a pokemon. As someone who started with 1st gen and quit playing due to pacing issues after gen 3, to pick it up again recently the pace feels much faster than any game since gen 3.Setting/Design: The designs of the region/Pokemon have a old world theme to them, the rest are as you would know and love. Except Garados flying though the sky like a Boeing 747Story: while I have not finished the game yet. It is not the same story that has been in every Pokemon game past gen 2. No boring badge hunt. Instead we are filling out the pokedex to gain stars within the faction.Best Feature: everything to experience is contained in one game not two titles with Pokemon missing from each.Summery: I think this is the best thing that can happen to Pokemon. It feels like a step forward for a franchise that has stuck a new coat of paint on the same game for the last 20 years.

The action based catching mechanics are perfect. Try to sneak up on a PokÃ©mon and catch it and if that fails smack it with a mud ball and try to catch it again. Movement with the mounts and the freedom of movement in the game is a very welcome addition.

309,"This is easily one of the best Pokemon games since Pokemon Black and White era.It's a breath of fresh air for the Pokemon series, and having the ability to be able to roam around to catch new Pokemon, experience new little details that were added to the game. The tutorial, whilst a little too long for my liking, still teaches you all the ropes of the game, and once you get over that, it's no longer the hand-holding game that has been the previous games.Being able to ignore the main story for hours on end, just so you can explore and experience new areas, Pokemon and witness them with sentience is something else that is amazing.The battle system has been reworked, and it will take a little bit to get used to. However, once you get the ropes of the battle system, along with Strong and Agile style moves, lots of great strategies can be born. And, once you master the battle system, it will be extremely fun to play around with, using moves that you might've not before, and using strategies that you would have never even thought of.The dark theme of the game overall, with death, mauling, and having the fear of Pokemon struck into your heart when they attack you in the wild, and you must run away, and fear for your life as they chase you down. It's a step toward something great. Pokemon aren't just creatures that will do a trainers bidding, they were once wild, untamed and it shows in this era of Pokemon that they possessed a true threat to humankind.The graphics are a little off... but who plays Pokemon for the graphics? It's all about the creatures, and catching them all, which is desperately needed in this game to actually complete it.Overall, Pokemon Legends Arceus is a very fun, and addicting game. The music in the background as you explore is something that can easily be enjoyed. The gameplay loop is incredibily enjoyable for those that are completionists, and want to 100% complete a game. It certainly is a step in the right direction for the Pokemon company, and this is a great, solid baseline for future games.",02-Feb-22,10,0.6,2,2,0

339,"Well, normally I wouldn't give this game a 10/10 but an 8/10 but because there are so many morrons here which give the game a 0 or 3/10, I will give it a 10.Giving this game just a 0 or a 3 or even a 5/10 is just objectivly not true, even if you dislike the game.Now, where to start with this game...I personally absolutly adore it.I have over 70 hours right now put into it and I think it is the best Pokemon game since Black & White. Personally I was never a fan of the 3D Pokemon games until Legends Arceus came out.Now, I want to address the biggest issue people have first: The graphics.The graphics are a 2 sided coin in this game. If you look at the game in TV mode, it looks terrible. Simply terrible. The performance in TV mode is also terrible. It often feels like a 20 FPS game.But...if you look at this game in handheld mode, it can actually look really pretty in some parts. If you have the game already, just compare a run through Jubilife Village between the TV mode and the handheld mode.You will notice that the handheld mode runs extremly well and looks really good in some areas.But you will also notice that the TV mode is the opposite of that.I would advise anyone to play this game ONLY in handheld mode! Personally, I can only say that this game is an 8/10 because I only played in handheld mode.If I have to judge the game by it's TV mode, it would be a 4 or 5/10. That's how big the difference is.Even despite me acknowledging the bad graphics in TV mode, I still think a lot of reviews here are extremly unfair towards the game. Calling Gamefreak lazy or terrible in this case is not true.Pokemon Legends Arceus was clearly a passion project for Gamefreak. You can see it in a lot of details they put in the game. Especially Jubilife Village. That is probably the best Pokemon village or town we had since the games went 3D. There are so many small details put into Jubilife Village, it is insane.For spoiler reasons I will not mention any. I will just say, this game was clearly a passion project for Gamefreak and even with flaws like the terrible TV mode, you can clearly see that they tried this time with the game.I honestly want this to be the main take-away from anyone who reads this review:The game is awesome if you play it as a handheld game.But if you play it as a homeconsole game, it is mediocre at best.I honestly would wish that Gamefreak just disabled the TV mode for this game and made it handheld only. Yes, people would still be angry about that but I think we would have way less people complaining about the graphics, if Gamefreak was just honest with their terrible TV mode.It also sadly just shows me how the Switch in itself makes it hard to judge games.Like I said, I give this game a 10/10 because morrons put negative reviews out which are WAY to negative for such an wellpolished handheld game.On the other hand, I can understand those reviews if they only played in TV mode.Like I said, I would personally give this game an 8/10 as a handheld game.But as a homeconsole game, it's in the 3-5/10 area.It also shows the duality of the Switch itself. The console itself is great but there are always set-backs which drag it down. We can clearly see it with other Switch games too.For example: Breath of the Wild can sometimes have a bad performance if you play it in TV mode. But in handheld mode, it's completly fine.Now, I didn't really talk about gameplay or story or anything like that because...I think it is quite clear that I enjoyed the gameplay in itself if I would give this game an 8 or 10/10.About the story...I really liked some of the characters. They are not great, but entertaining enough.The story in itself is good, but not great. It more or less is just an excuse to send you running through the world.In general, this game is extremly gameplay focused and I really don't want to say anything about that because there are a lot of surprises here. It is not comparable to previous Pokemon games, that much is clear.But in my opinion, Gamefreak should continue going in the ""Legends"" direction.If the next Legends game is not on the Switch or on an more powerful Switch, we might even get a game with a working handheld AND TV-mode!Gonna add one thing here:People who give this game 0 or 3/10 are objectivly wrong. Even if the graphics were as terrible as everyone said (which they are only for TV mode and even than, it could be way worse), this game is objectivly not a Zero.Morrons like that should honestly stop playing Pokemon in general. Why? Because disencouraging Gamefreak now with bad review scores is REALLY not the thing we need now.I don't say just blindly applaud them but if people continue to hate on this game, we will just get the same old terrible Pokemon formula again.",07-Feb-22,10,0.75,1,1,0

341,"This was an exciting new leap and formula for Pokemon! I have played every game from since red and blue from the the very beginning. This game took so much fan base complaints and molded this game into something fresh and exhilarating. The graphics are something that can always be improved upon but we are dealing with the 5 year old console switch graphical capabilities. There are occasional glitches but they are few far in between and doesn?t affect the playability. Can this series improve of course, but the game is so addicting I?ve spent almost 30+ hours just in the first section exploring catching this game is beautiful and makes me want to complete everything something the other previous games made boring.",06-Feb-22,10,0.75,1,1,0

The Graphics lack, but by no means bad, even grand in many places.The game nails in every manner put forth and I've been completely blown away by the quality.

With the ability to control the camera angle was great from Sword and Shield's wild area but in this game, we are free to use this feature everywhere. As well as the battles and while talking to NPCs in some case. I really enjoy playing this game and spending hours and hours in it catching'em all. Really appriciate their effort in this game.

345,"I?ve played every single PokÃ©mon game for the last 25 years. PokÃ©mon is my favorite franchise of all time, so I?m not one of these trolls on the internet who like to shout extra loud about how bad a PokÃ©mon game is when they aren?t actually fans of the series. You won?t see me waking up extra early and logging online to scream bad opinions to the void about video games that don?t interest me. I?m not out here critiquing first person shooters cause I have no place doing so.. because I don?t enjoy them. Plain and simple. The people online with the extra harsh criticism of this game are exactly that. Trust me, if you are a real PokÃ©mon fan this game is everything. I?ve never had more fun playing a PokÃ©mon game, ever. (Well I won?t count Gold and Silver, that?s pure nostalgia)This game has me so excited for the future of the series. It?s a glimpse into soooo much potential and it?s just such a pure good time. The franchise is notorious for taking very small steps forward at a time. This was a GIANT leap. Game freak have never takin this much of a jump forward and it?s exciting. The story is actually interesting and I find myself really taking my time as to not rush through it. which to be frank, I haven?t found myself super enthralled by a PokÃ©mon games story in a very long time. It?s a breath of fresh air and a fun new way to play. The game isn?t focused on the same aspect we are used to. So you have to remember that the focus is exploring and research, not gym badges and elite 4.. and it?s very good at what it?s intended for. I?m 60 hours in and still only half way through the main story. I have been letting myself get lost and immersed in the world. There is so much to complete that I know it?ll easily take a almost 200 hours to do everything. Going to each new area is always exciting and discovering PokÃ©mon in their habitats never gets old. You?ll find yourself excited to see a PokÃ©mon you?ve seen a million times in other games. They put a lot of time into each PokÃ©mon having their own personalities and animations. They feel more alive than ever. It?s challenging as well. If you?re not prepared before venturing out you can find yourself getting attacked by a gang of PokÃ©mon and blacking out real fast. We?ve never been able to experience such a realistic feel to PokÃ©mon in the wild. It?s amazing. I could go on and on and on. Honestly just buy it.And get excited for what?s hopefully just a glimpse into what?s to come for the PokÃ©mon series!!",08-Feb-22,10,0.5,1,1,0

Initially, I'd give it 7/10, but the more I played it the more I liked this - there's plenty of content in this one, and they're adding new quests in updates.

As others have said, visually the game is a little lackluster (it looks like what I would expect a launch title for the Switch to look like). Graphics aside, the game is a breath of fresh air for the series in my opinion. I?m enjoying exploring the world, learning the mechanics, and doing everything there is to do in the game. I?m definitely taking my time with the game and am enjoying every minute of it. I?ve read the reviews, and I think a lot of the 0 ratings are trolls who watched the trailer and didn?t like the direction the game has taken. Please don?t listen to the trolls, but also don?t take the perfect 10 scores too seriously and think the game is perfect.

372,"This game is incredible. I've been so addicted to it since I got it. I remember as a kid playing outside with my friends like we were Pokemon trainers . . . Pokemon Legends Arceus is exactly what I envisioned playing Pokemon should be like.They seem to have actually considered the kind of game that people want when they think of playing Pokemon. Exploring, finding them in their natural habitats, and everything is just quick and fluid. The gameplay loop of explore/catch/rework team is super refined and I'm almost sad that we didn't get a Pokemon game like this much, much earlier.It's not all perfect though. GameFreak simply doesn't allocate nearly enough budget for their game development. As a result, this game visually looks like it could have been on the Wii. There was basically no budget for cinematics and so there's so much stuff that is expressed in text that characters are doing but it just goes to a black screen because they didn't actually animate that. (You know, you'd think a franchise that has one of the most popular and long-running TV series to go with it would have the budget to do that? Not to mention voice acting and orchestrated soundtrack -- which obviously they have for the TV series).But enough of the bad.

Being able to quickly pick between pokemon and send them out whenever you want feels great. Gathering resources is streamlined and doesn't feel like a chore. The fact that battles take place in the overworld and you don't lose control of your character also feels amazing and it helps connecting to the world and your team a lot more.The story is also more developed and engaging than anything Gamefreak has done in the past. Some characters are a bit too over the top but I guess it wouldn't be Pokemon without that.The presentation is the biggest drawback. The pokemon models look great and they are well animated. The VFX is also great so you won't be disappointed with the way the moves look. The textures however are absolutely horrible. There's a lot of pop-in and there's this purple shader over everything for no reason. The frame rate also dips in the mid twenties from time to time. Especially during boss battles.

I didn't expect to succeed and yet it did (by switch standards).Got the game one day after release and been addicted since then. The core gameplay is very fun. It's very effective. My only complaints are that it's a bit strange that you always have to head back to jubilife village before heading to another zone. Also, I would love the combat to be perhaps just a bit more interactive, not that I dislike the classical turn base stuff, but maybe something Paper-Mario-esque, hell even better: like the tales series, though that could be asking for a bit muchOn the graphical side, I think people are a bit harsh. Though, I compare this to Shin Megami Tensei V. The games run at similar performance (30 fps with the occasionnal stuter). I do believe SMTV looks better though. Not a huge complaint here, knowing the limitations of the switch. Game is still charming and doesn't look too bad.Music is great. Enjoying the themes.Game progression seems much more fast paced. I have never been a huge fan of the whole exp share thing, but I think they got it right this time as the game just seems more difficult that other pokemon games (alpha pokemons, 1 vs 2-3 aggro encounters)Writing this review with over 50 hours in.9/10 for me.

389,"Pokemon Legends Arceus is without a doubt the boldest and most ambitious entry in the history of the franchise. Setting out in the beautiful region of Hisui, this game caputres the same ""open air"" feeling Nintendo was able to achieve with Breath of the Wild. With an emphasis on capturing as opposed to battling, this game takes all of the best concepts of Let's Go and combined them with their core franchise to create a truly unique experience all it's own. The best element of this bold new venture is it's absolutely fantastic story. While a bit text heavy at times, this is the first Pokemon game Gamefreak has made since Black/White with a strong focus on story and they without a doubt knocked it out of the park with strong characters and emotional moments that moved me unlike any Pokemon game ever had before. In addition to a great story with fantastic characters, the game is absolutely beautiful and stunning to explore. Sure the Switch can only push graphics so far and some of the renders are far from perfect, but in the early hours of playing I found myself amazed and constantly thinking ""I can't believe this is a Pokemon game."" The gameplay loop is insanely addictive too; explore, capture, explore more, capture again, and before you know it you've lost hours of your life having a blast. With charming environments, soothing music, addictive gameplay, and the exciting feeling of encountering a new Pokemon it's very difficult not to find yourself smiling every time you play.I could go on about the specific joys of this game like the thrilling boss battles, cutscenes, increased shiny encounters, crafting, the thrill of the hunt, wonderful new Hisuian forms and so much more, but I'll keep it as brief as possible. This game feels like both the true return to Diamond/Pearl as well as the next big Pokemon game we've all been waiting for. I have no doubt this will serve as the foundation for a whole Legends sub-series and when I think about this only being the beginning, I tremble with excitement to think of what can come next.

There?s always something to do?earn money, complete sidequests, work on the dex, catch new Pokemon, strengthen your Pokemon, collect rare items, and shiny hunt. It cannot be stressed enough that you can switch activities at a whim. That level 39 cherrim my trainer fought for literally 24 in-game hours as I threw every kind of ball in the game at it? I got so annoyed I ran, caught 4 other Pokemon is succession, and switched areas to earn some money. It takes a bit for you to unlock every area, but you can always return to areas you?ve unlocked.Strategy-wise, I had the most fun playing this game than any other in a long time when I went to encounter a flock of Ursaring. Each one was ten levels higher than my strongest Pokemon, so I had to try to lure them out one at a time. Problem was, luring them out too far lead to interruptions from other Pokemon like Luxio/Luxray. When I finally managed to isolate one, they could still wipe my team easily so I had to develop a strategy to consistently defeat them. It was an absolute blast, and an unexpected challenge.Fifty hours in, and the strategy remains. However, it does get to the point where you?re just chucking balls at everything you see to fill the dex. It minimizes the strategy of the game and eliminates challenge, and that impacts the fun. I love the font, but the graphics really need attention. It?s not just rough around the edges, there?s missed potential. And there should be more ways to interact with the Pokemon you?ve caught. Literally, work on the graphics in every department and you?ve got something really special.What makes this entry so exciting is the idea that Pokemon might consider evolving from its roots to something bigger, and in many people?s opinions, including my own, something better. Definitely a game worth reviewing.",03-Feb-22,9,0.5,13,13,8.4
394,this pokemon game is better then the last like 4 games (not including ultra sun and moon as that games post game and improvements made it a better game in my opinion) this game is in my opinion really fun for me this game is a 9 but for others i can see it being a 7 to 8 but if you like pokemon or want to get into it or back into it i recommend this game the graphics are bad yeah but arent even that important nor will it take from your experience of this game its really addicting and definately worth playing,30-Jan-22,9,0.829268293,9,9,8.3
395,"Es el mejor juego de PokÃ©mon de la Ãºltima dÃ©cada. El cambio de formato se siente como un aire fresco y renovador para la saga. El habitual jpg basado en gimnasios y liga llegÃ³ a su culmen en PokÃ©mon blanco y negro y sus secuelas, y las entregas posteriores solo fueron a peor, culminando en el desastre de PokÃ©mon espada y escudo, y en los ""remaster"" (porque no remake) de sinnoh. Para el futuro, arreglar el apartado grÃ¡fico, porque le resta mucho y le posiciona a los ojos del pÃºblico (comprensiblemente) en una posiciÃ³n muy inferior a la que mereciera con respecto a los tÃ­tulos lanzados en 2022. Incluso con ese apartado grÃ¡fico, Leyendas PokÃ©mon Arceus es fÃ¡cilmente uno de los mejores PokÃ©mon de la historia, y el mejor PokÃ©mon en Nintendo Switch, eclipsando y dejando en evidencia a las Ãºltimas tres generaciones de PokÃ©mon y todos los spin off que las han acompaÃ±ado. Un digno GOTY y 10 si tuviera un apartado grÃ¡fico a la altura de esta saga. Sin embargo, juego indispensable de game freak, que por fin se atreve a salir de su zona de confort, y de una forma bastante acertada.

397,"The best Pokemon game in years. Completely tears up the rules surrounding what a Pokemon game has to be and delivers a fresh, more logical take on the series. The story actually feels like some effort was put in, and the interactions with NPCs are ACTUALLY ENJOYABLE.This universe is so much more engaging, as people act like real people confronted with these terrifying creatures known as Pokemon. It actually feels like there's a point to working on the Pokedex as you educate people around the region on what Pokemon are. (this Sudowoodo is sad, but it's a plant so maybe spraying it with water pulse will help! lol)The battle system is vastly improved as well. Popping into a battle is much faster than in S&S or D&P to the point that bet if you play this and then go back to either of those it's the first thing you notice. Also, ability to move around in battle means during quick battles you can choose your attack and then start running before the battle even ends. It's so much fresher.Catching Pokemon is faster too, as you can catch them the normal way (unless they run, which happens a lot) or you can sneak around and stealth his them with a ball like the survivalist Pokemon trainer you are. The Pokemon GO influence here works great imo. It makes you feel like Pokemon are actually these wild creatures with habitats and temperaments.Finally, just a small thing, but I like how you can always run from a battle. It never made sense that you couldn't in previous games outside ""these are the rules of Pokemon games."" In Arceus, you just call you Pokemon back and run tf away which is much more realistic. Which sort of encapsulates what I like so much about this game, things just make way more sense within the context of Pokemon existing.I love it and beg Nintendo to please make more. This game is VERY different from previous games though, so that may bother you (although if you're one of those people who like to meme about Pokemon making the same game year after year, I hope this doesn't bother you)Cons: The art is really pretty, but looks like **** on the big screen.

Genuinely loving this game so far and glad to see there is still lots to do after the credits roll. Graphics could use some polishing (the caves are pretty... yeah)but the graphics dont make the game for me, personally.

Its the pokemon game we all wanted 10years ago but never too late i guess. Very addictive game, ive thoroughly enjoyed it, so much to do, could easily sink 100 hours in to it.Negatives for me is the lack of online and the graphics, no voice acting and music. Also i think the battle system needs to move from turn based to more of a free moving system. But regardless of all these faults it has to be one of the best pokemon games since gold silver for me personally. Its a step in the right direction but has much to improve on.Honestly a great game and anything i sink 100hours in to is a high rating game.",07-Feb-22,9,0.75,2,2,0

You have to complete the pokedex and revive the village for a reason that make sense in the story.Grafic is the reason my score is not 10. Still is better than what i tought but inferior compared to other switch titles. A HUGE step in the right direction for gamefreak.

413,"So we finally have a game that Gamefreak have put some effort in, however does it actually work? Minor spoilers if you haven't watched trailers so be warned.So my first sitting I sat there for 9 hours straight giving this an honest go so I can put together a fair review. I played it all on stream and said my pros and cons there but here they are in text for others to read and decide on if they want to purchase. I have now put in 35 hours I can put together a fair review.Overall, Yes this game is worth and I am very impressed Gamefreak took this risk and I hope future games use this type of system. There are some things they could have done better which I'll go into first PokÃ©mon at night could have more of a variety, every map has 80% of the same PokÃ©mon at night except a few that are exclusive to that map at night. It's most driffloons you find which is annoying, but during the day there's a variety on each map. It's only at night it's lacking.Some side quests need some work, they need to be more descriptive or give you the maps name at least. Some of them give you a quest where you have to go an area but that name isn't on any map at all, someone would have mentioned the name but you'd have to remember.The map needs more little towns for immersivness, you have people coming from other existing places to your town. However you never actually find those towns, instead of having random quests on the maps to pick up you could have little towns you go pick them up from and then you could learn a little more of how those places operate at the same time. Except you just hear of all the places and never get to see them which is a shame.PokÃ©mon in the wild could have behaviour characteristics, get too close to another PokÃ©mon they could argue with each other or even fight, Have bidoofs collecting wood to make dams, Beatifly landing on trees and sucking the nectar. Just things to give the PokÃ©mon more life, they do go to sleep at night (If they don't despawn and get replaced with night PokÃ©mon which does happen).Now on to why it's such a great game.System.. The open world style really suits this game and it's a huge step forwards for the franchise. Being able to choose to try and catch a PokÃ©mon right away or battle it is great.. what's even better is being able to move while battling. This doesn't do anything but it lets you look around and if you annoy more than one PokÃ©mon you can end up battling as many enemies that are around you.Crafting.. Now this actually lets you do something with the open world style. Collect materials which you can find on the ground or get as rewards for catching/fainting pokemon. You might think it's a tedious thing but you don't need to craft you can just smash through the content however crafting does add a little more to do for those that like this type of thing. Collecting recipes and crafting those new recipe's to make fights easier in the future.Mounts.. You can run fast, break stuff, swim or fly and you can switch between them whenever you want with the D-Pad and if your currently on your running mount and go into water it will automatically switch to your swimming mount. Great addition Gamefreak, well done. However I wish you could actually fly around and fight flying PokÃ©mon in the sky.Danger.. Now you can actually faint from PokÃ©mon attacking you. This could do with being harder though it is very easy to dodge PokÃ©mon attacks or get away from them. However the fear of you actually fainting and loosing items you went out and crafted/bought is a cool addition to the game. Alpha PokÃ©mon are a great addition too. You can litterally throw your PokÃ©mon out anywhere and call them back, so you catch an alpha PokÃ©mon you can compare it's size to a regular one. You have a choice to either fight the wild PokÃ©mon or catch them right off the bat. Even aggressive PokÃ©mon can be approached with the correct items, I've caught about 10 Alpha PokÃ©mon without battling them.The side quests are both great and have their flaws at the same time. Most of the side quests have different styles quests, have a little story too them too but then around 1/5th side quests are just 'Fill X Pokemons Dex entry'. Which is too many in my opinion, your planning to finish all Dex entries anyway if you want the reward.Overall this game is a hard 9/10 I love that Gamefreak went for a risk and put so much effort into a new game rather than us getting a new 3DS game that's slightly bigger in map size. This is a great direction for new PokÃ©mon games, I see this as the BoTW of the series. This is a test to see if the audience enjoy this style of game and then in future we will get more immersive maps, maps will towns we are going to end up having a truly flawless game if they continue in this direction and don't just use this style of spin off games in the future.",02-Feb-22,9,0.666666667,5,5,8.8
414,"I can say that the game has been really enjoyable so far after 12 hours in game.

416,"Pokemon Legends Arceus is an amazing new direction for this series. and honestly it's a thousand times better than Sword and Shield were in my opinion. sure, i enjoyed Sword, but Legends is amazing. it feels like Pokemon meets Breath of the Wild sort of. that or maybe Pokemon meets Monster hunter Rise with how you go to multiple massive and open areas to explore and hunt things down in. also, it's just so much fun. graphics look... alright, but they're leagues better than Sword and Shield. the gameplay is solid, and much more like what i was hoping for when I saw the original reveal trailer. I love this game, but it's kinda tough to avoid getting wrecked by high level Alpha pokemon if you wander too far. oh, and i would say at least make save datas for a Pokemon Let's Go game, Sword or Shield, and Brilliant Diamond or Shining Pearl for some free clothing items and two bonus quests involving mythical pokemon in the postgame. oh, and it's also fantastic that my favorite starter pokemon, Cyndaquil, is a starter in this game, but i digress. just pick up the game for yourself and find out how good it is for yourself!",03-Feb-22,9,0.5,2,2,0

I was astounded at how many risks GameFreak has finally taken, I genuinly hope that this type of pokemon game gets polished more and is a new template for the series moving forward. However the graphics are in fact pretty awful, while usually that doesn't mean anything to me personally, somehow this game makes me notice more and the pop in is pretty anoying, I don't really understand how games like breath of the wild can be a launch title and look way more amazing due to clever art style tricks to make it run flawlessly on the Switch's limited hardware but I assume that after this game's success there will be more effort put into these aspects of the next Arceus like game. unfortunately the graphics do hold it back a bit but I'd rather have annoying graphic problems and a huge rework of PokÃ©mon than another bland mainline copy-paste PokÃ©mon game.",03-Feb-22,9,0.5,3,3,0
419,"Pros-This game has some of the most addictive and well designed gameplay loops I have played in a PokÃ©mon game. The game allows you to be curious and encourages it more often than not and it feels very rewarding for just exploring the map. It adds so many new quality of life updates and changes like the battle mechanics are expanded. These changes are long overdue for the PokÃ©mon IP and it works really well in the games favor. The music is amazing and is so pleasing especially in battles and just wandering around the open world. The story this time around is surprisingly decent and kept me invested. The PokÃ©mon formula is changed for the better and it really works in the games' favor. Also the actual PokÃ©mon have an actual personality and it is very refreshing to see.Cons-Honestly, this game is really ugly looking at most times and the graphics are just not up to par even for a switch game. There is a lot of jank in the controls and it takes away from the experience. The game does have a certain lack of polish that I am sure will be somewhat fixed but at release the polish or lack thereof definitely is noticeableConclusion-All of the problems I mentioned are a problem and I wish Game Freak was given perhaps a few more months to iron things out, Even though that didn't happen, PokÃ©mon Legends: Arceus is one of the most well designed and compelling PokÃ©mon games ever and is able to overcome those shortcomings.

433,"I've been playing Pokemon games since gen 1. I've enjoyed every Pokemon game since then. Pokemon Legends Arceus is a great video game, perhaps one of the best on Switch if not the absolute best, but it is not the best Pokemon game per say.First off, graphically, it looks fine. Pokemon games have never been visually impressive and I personally don't see a whole lot of difference between this game graphically and something like Breath of the Wild. The sounds are great. The music sound track hits hard and the game itself makes good use of sound effects. Sometimes you can kind of tell where a Pokemon might be just by listening. It helped me a lot as it was much easier to tell when a Pokemon was about to attack. Performance is fine. The game is 30 FPS, but it's a consistent 30 FPS. Personally, while I do prefer 60 FPS, I don't actually mind 30 FPS as long as it's consistent and the framerate here is good enough for me.Of course though, this is a Pokemon game, so gameplay is what really matters. This game is very fun and very addictive. It's relaxing to go out looking for Pokemon. The boss battles need a bit of work, but generally I've had fun with this game. It's very addictive. I don't have a whole lot of free time due to work and stuff, so the fact that I've played about 50 hours of this game in just the last week that it's been out says a lot. The crafting system is a nice idea, but it needs a bit of work to be really good. A lot of the resources you gather are only good for one or two specific items and that seems like a bit of a waste. It would be a nice if you had to think about which resources you wanted to use for which items and if each resource had a few different uses. As it is, you have resources that are very specifically for certain types of pokeballs, resources that are very specific for certain types of medicine, etc. It gets to a point where you simply just don't collect certain resources because you simply have no good use for them. The Pokemon themselves however is what really matters. Battling them is fun and switching between the overworld and the battles themselves has never been better. I do think the move pool is lacking. I noticed a lot of moves seem to have been taken out of the game and while in some ways that helps balance the battles, it makes it difficult to get the right moves for certain Pokemon and type coverage becomes difficult. Speaking of variety, Pokemon is where this game needs a LOT of work. The Pokedex is only about 250 Pokemon, the smallest we've ever had outside of remakes. Most of those Pokemon are from Sinnoh, which makes sense given the story. However, it's a bit disappointing to see such a limited number of Pokemon in this type of enviornment. There was about 10-12 Pokemon that seem to be available in every area and with as many Pokemon are there are, this simply shouldn't be the case. I know people have complaints about Sword and Shield, but this is something they really got right with the wild area in Sword and Shield, so it's disappointing to see how limited the selection of Pokemon is here. A 400-500 pokemon size of Pokedex would make a lot more sense here.The story is very good. It's not the absolute best story we've ever gotten in Pokemon, but it easily makes the top 5. My only real complaint is that there is much too much handholding through the story. In other Pokemon games, this makes sense, given how linear the games are in the first place. Here however, it makes a lot less sense given the open world enviornments. All I really want to do is explore the enviornment and they almost seem to force the story upon you instead. I do like the rewards for Pokedex completion and completion of the game itself as you go. This game gives the most insentive to keep going out of all the Pokemon games and easily gives the best rewards. You get money for pokedex completion and I find myself continuing to catch as many Pokemon as I can so I can get more money to get more items and clothes. I do wish there were more clothing options, but the ones that are there are good. There's also way more shiny hunting options than usual, which is nice for people who enjoy that sort of thing.All in all, Pokemon Legends Arceus is a very good game, but if you are looking to pick up your first Pokemon game, I'd recommend Sword and Shield first and then checking this out afterwards. This is easily the better game, but Sword and Shield is the better Pokemon experience where you get to see and do more Pokemon related stuff. I'd say both games are 100 percent must plays for anyone interested in Pokemon. Pokemon Legends Arceus is very good groundwork for future games and I certainly plan on following to see what they continue to do with the Pokemon Legends series. I think with a bit of refinement and just generally taking everything a bit farther, this very well could be the future of main line Pokemon games and that excites me.",04-Feb-22,9,0.8,21,21,7.9

Pokemon Legends Arceus has been a wild ride, a massive step forward for the series which I hope we see going forward. I?ve played every single Pokemon game since FRLG and grew up with the series and never felt more emboldened by it since then.Catching Pokemon has never been easier yet still more in-depth, battles are fun and closer to what the anime portrays the world like. Full of environmental storytelling if you go looking for it and characters that you?ll recognise from other games but with little twists along the way by making use of it?s settings.Legends Arceus also takes some more steps forward in terms of the behind the scenes mechanics that I think would be good to take forward into the future competitively and also makes it better for casual players by not punishing you too hard if you beat legendaries or rare spawns.There?s some occasional pop in and sometimes the models look a bit slow when at a distance, but that?s been my only real problem with this game.

The graphics are nice for nintendo switch and fit the game. The main history could have been longer (one or two ""seÃ±orial"" more). It copies lots of things of Dragon Quest Monters Joker 3 which was only released in Japan and advanced PokÃ©mon (still one DQ monsters in development though).

Legends Arceus, as a PokÃ©mon game is incredible, it?s a refreshing new take on the tired old PokÃ©mon formula while also streamlining many features originating from the older games. As a stand-alone game however, this game is still good but I can?t sing praise about Legends without taking about the graphical quality. On handheld mode, the graphics look perfectly fine and most people probably could get used to it within a matter of minutes however, docked the graphical issues are made much more apparent with the game looking like something from the GameCube or Wii era.

I feel like fun hasn?t been part of a PokÃ©mon game in a while. I love being chased down by random aggro mons. I love the fact that there is an actual story. The ability to craft and farm is also a nice touch. Being able to swap a PokÃ©mon's move on the fly is a great quality of life feature.

While I think the people complaining about graphics generally are being a bit dramatic, the game is poorly optimized and does feel like it needs some tuning up.

Honestly for a Pokemon game, the story is pretty good, and the game play loop, while it's different, it's pretty fun, and makes catching Pokemon very fun to do.The game isn't really focused on fighting and collecting gym badges, instead you build up the first Pokedex, it sounds like it's grueling, but it's easier to make progress than you think, and it feels good to reach new ranks and go to new areas, the Ride Pokemon in this game are very fun to use, and feel well integrated into the design of the environment. Speaking of the environment, it's really good looking, the graphics look very polished and honestly is one of the best looking Pokemon games, this is definitely one of, if not my favorite game in the series.

463,"I was very jaded when it comes to the Pokemon franchise, simply because GameFreak fed us with sub-par/overpriced games for the last 5-6 years that also contained design choices that were simply put baffling. The continous targeting of a younger and younger audience made the games feel like shallow, not fleshed-out ""mash A"" adventures. This is why I had so much trouble accepting this but here I am: Legends Arceus is a very decent game.Story:Right of the bat you have a story that is more akin to Gen5, one where people talk about actually dying. Not to mention that you get send down to earth by god himself. The stakes often seem high throughout the story, like at the point when the 3 bandit sisters snag Growlithe and you have to rescue it. The characters themselves are mostly fleshed-out, sometimes (like in the case of the male/female counterpart of the player) they could have done more but all in all the individual characters motivations and behavior make sense.Dfficulty:Not too difficult, not too easy. In my opinion they could habe bumped up the difficulty of the game quite a bit more but it is a decent level of difficulty where you can't just mash A until the credits pop up, which makes it far more enjoyable. Especially when you go out of your way to fight higher level alphas it becomes a lot more challenging (e.g. I caught a 61 alpha Ninetales when my mons were around level 40).Gameplay:This game is hands down the biggest departure from the usual formula and it does what it does pretty good. The new fighting style is different and refreshing, the fact that you can just run around during fights and even get hit by both the enemies AND your own attacks is a very nice touch. The crafting is a fun side activity that gives you enough oi an incentive to collect most of the stuff along your way, which makes for a more coherent experience. I love that you can just run into higher level areas and even fight the mons there, it felt extremely threatening to run into that alpha Snorlax at level 42 right at the start of the game.Graphics:Yeah, they are **** The Pokemon themselves look clean if I'm honest, the attack animations also look decent and oftentimes even straight up amazing (like Hyper Beam, Hydro Pump or Blizzard) but the terrain looks like some intern did it in a blender. The grass looks worse than Mario 64 and the cliff walls look like they even glitch out from time to time. Yeah, Graphics are not the most important thing in the world but I would have expected more than PS2 graphics.Rest:The sidequests are fun and diverse. Yeah at the core they are often similar and some of them are boring as well but the games usually sells them to you like they arent, which makes them feel less repetitive (you even have one where you catch a guaranteed shiny which you even get to keep).You can put all of your Pokemon out of their balls in Jubilife and they even interact with one another. Such nuances never made it into the game or they were implement in a lazy way but it just makes it feel so much more realistic that way.All in all: Legends Arceus is a good game and worth the money. You will get a very breath of the wild like feeling where you oftentimes just run around doing anything but the main story quest.",29-Jan-22,9,0.830188679,2,2,0

465,"I was looking at all of the negative reviews for this game and all of them were just complaining about the graphics or the difficulty. The game is definitely more difficult than some of the most recent games but it's not too difficult. When I faint or lose, I don't feel like it's unfair because it's mostly my own fault. And the graphics are actually a step up compared to PokÃ©mon Sword and Shield. Although they are a step up, they aren't too great at times. Sometimes you will see parts of hills in the distance randomly load in right in front of you or even sometimes tree or PokÃ©mon on rare occasions. Overall, the graphics I'd give a low 7/10. But every other aspect of the game is phenomenal, and a big step up compared to previous entries of the series and is why I'm rating this game a 9 out of 10. This game truly is a great game and is a big step up compared to previous games. Especially comparing this game to PokÃ©mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. And anyone who thinks that this game is somehow 'worse"" or 'just as bad"" as the other games, is completely wrong. This game gives amazing changes and some small changes you may not recognize your first time playing through the game.

As someone whos played every single pokemon game to ever release when they released. its a breath of fresh air to come away from a old clunky and boring system. Yes having abilitys would of been preferred, yes i get the competitive side being weak is frustrating for some people but for others who just want a solid non competitive pokemon game for the first time in many years this satisfys that itch.

467,"This game is a huge leap for its franchise and just a fun and good PokÃ©mon game.You start with a good and deservedly long tutorial.If you are a long die-hard fan of the PokÃ©mon franchise, you immediately notice the fundamental changes that were made. You actually get a good introduction into the new movement and the catching system. If you are someone that is in some way unbiased and pick up the game because it looks interesting, it is just as good. Unlike many PokÃ©mon games before this (e.g. Sword & Shield), this game actually has depth and story that I would let adults enjoy. It's a world in which PokÃ©mon are wild, people are afraid of them and don't even dare to touch them. If you do not come prepared or act rashly, you can very well lose your life from an NPC's standpoint. It's not an exaggeration to say that this is the situation people of the Hisui region are facing. The tutorial doesn't start with you yet again saving the professor from a life and death situation, choosing your starter and off you go... I like it!Graphically, there is a lot of room for improvement. Textures are somewhat presentable. Playing in handheld mode eases the pain but once you plug it into the dock and hook that thing up to a 4K-TV, you just notice the many rather unattractive aspects this game sadly has to offer.Being already on the visual points, the attack animations are crisp and look very good.NPC's finally look more like actual people with more added facial expressions, less repetitive movements (look up Sun and Moon as a bad example) and a IMO somewhat better dialogue in general.Most character designs are creative, stick out and are memorable. Their personalities are not nearly as one-sided as what we are used to in the latest games so that even e.g. a group of thieves you encounter after a couple hours of gameplay explains, that they just steal in order to survive. There is just more reasoning behind the tasks and conversations you are faced with.The ""multiplayer"" (if you can even call it that), is so minuscule that you would forget there even is such a thing. I would say that it actually adds to immersion that you are mostly alone in these open-world-levels but I would still gladly take an improvement to the current solution of just picking up other players lost items for a slight reward.Trainer battles are very scarce. In a way it makes sense, since there shouldn't be many trainers around anyway (speaking logically). It doesn't lack of fighting in general since you do this more than enough with other wild PokÃ©mon but there is a slight lack of the 'ol tiny bit of competitiveness you would get in defeating the Elite four. I would like to see more options to choose and challenge certain NPCs for a battle. There actually is a training ground in the village that story wise is maybe used only a couple times? (by the time I have played, there was only one battle on it). There is no real fighting interaction you can do to challenge someone.The Music is good, the sound design has gotten better (i.e. you actually hear an echo of your PokÃ©mons screams when fighting in ruins) and the engaging gameplay with its new fundamentals of stealthily sneaking up to PokÃ©mon in order to catch them, actual trainer vulnerability and the other already mentioned things is just fun!And that's what this game is: fun!To me it is safe to say that this level of lore, depth, atmosphere and gameplay and design should be the new standard for this franchise!",31-Jan-22,9,0.852459016,1,1,0

This game is probably not for everyone either, considering it's a strictly a single-player experience about completing the pokedex(which I had never bothered to do before in previous games but for some reason I find it addicting in this game).

480,"Disclaimer: If you care a lot about graphics and not gameplay, this isn?t the game for you. Giving the game a 3 just because the graphics are lacking is shallow.I have been playing Pokemon since Diamond and Pearl on the DS, and this is the most fun I?ve had with a Pokemon game since. This is mostly due to the well structured gameplay loop. There are lots of ways you can approach battling and catching Pokemon, and this freedom really defines the entire game. Instead of pressing a button to run away from a battle, you can just actually run away. You can move during a battle giving you any perspective you?d like. Once you get past the tutorial, you are free to explore a large area with lots of danger and excitement. Besides that, every mechanic implemented is streamlined to perfection. The gameplay is a much needed and revolutionary step in the Pokemon franchise. The gameplay earned itself a 10/10.A valid point of critique is that the graphics are lacking. Don?t get me wrong, there are some moments where the game looked pretty, but overall it?s very very mediocre. The textures are often compared to the Wii era, and let me tell you, they?re not far off. Furthermore, there is the usual pop-in of trees and rocks which isn?t always noticeable, but is very jarring when you do notice it. Luckily the Pokemon themselves do not pop in as heavily, they are usually seen from further away at the expense of a lower frame rate. The pop in has been improved from earlier titles like Pokemon Sword and Shield. Overall the graphics leave a lot to be desired. Though it does add enough to game overall, therefore I rate this department a 6/10.I was pleasantly surprised by the sound design in the game, though I didn?t expect anything else from the GameFreak veteran Go Ichinose. The soundscapes in Legends Arceus take the immersion to a new level for the series. The world of Pokemon has never felt more alive. My favorite sounds are those of the player movement. Rolling, sprinting, crouching in the grass, throwing a pokeball. I am a massive fan of this amount of detail. The soundtracks in the game are subtle, and reminds one of Zelda Breath of the Wild. There are some beautiful renditions in there of older soundtracks of the Sinnoh region, one of my favorite being Jubilife Village. The games sound earned itself a 10/10.People asked for better animations, and they got it. There are a lot of new animations for the Pokemon themselves, the moves, the NPCs and much more. GameFreak outdid themselves in this department. It?s really the little things that sold me on the animations. Pokemon actually make eye contact, the trainer can be seen showing actual emotions. After a heavy battle, the player often wipes off some sweat. The player can get hit by a Pokemon?s moves and you can see the player retreat a Pokemon to their pokeball. Sure, they?re small things but it?s never seen before in the Pokemon franchise, a recurring theme in Pokemon Legends Arceus. There are some moments where GameFreak could?ve done more, or better said; at least something. The game still fades to black in cutscenes where two characters are supposed to interact with each other, which just comes across as lazy. It?s an easy technique to avoid animating something, and for real time events that?s acceptable. However, we are talking about cutscenes here. GameFreak?s cutscenes are outdated, and it?s sad they didn?t improve them for this game. There are lots of things to love in the animation department, but it?s not perfect. Therefore the animations are a 9/10 for me.To conclude, Pokemon Legends Arceus is a game worth your time. Whether you are new to the franchise or a veteran. Everything combined, this game is a 9/10.",30-Jan-22,9,0.851851852,1,1,0

You get to use your hard crafted team less than ever. There should be more trainer battles to make up for this.- Needs more puzzles.- Needs more dungeons, multilevel caves, temples etc. The stone query was good but needs more areas like that, more levels, ladders.- Dumbed down pokemon move variety. No abilities.PROS:- The definitive correct next step for pokemon.- Different overworld pkm sizes. Seamless battle/overworld transition.- Rider pokemon. Good job but also consider allowing other flying/4 leg/2 leg(climb) types. Just strap your straddle on an arcenine or luxray for example.- Side missions are a good step.

534,PokÃ©mon Legends Arceus is a breath of fresh air for the franchise after playing 8 generations of game that all feel like the last one. The new catching mechanic makes catching PokÃ©mon fun again and not some long and annoying prosses to catch the PokÃ©mon you want on your team or if your trying to fill the pokedex. The more open game makes it feel like you a have more freedom the in past games and that's a huge plus for me even if its not completely open world like BOTW. The difficulty in this game is also something to love because not only is battling regular wild PokÃ©mon a bit of a challenge but the new alpha and noble PokÃ©mon can 1 to 2 shot almost any member of your team if you are not crazy over leveled. Also dodging PokÃ©mon in the game is also a challenge I blacked out 3 times from PokÃ©mon attacking me. I promise you if you are not paying attention to make sure PokÃ©mon don't see you and if multiple PokÃ©mon are attacking in mass you will have problems. I'm 24 hours in and I still haven't beaten the 3 noble boss fight but so far the story is ok it actually feels like a story compared to SWSH but those games were still good to me. I could go on all day about everything I love about this game but I still have to say that this game is not perfect. The graphics could be a LOT better but they are not God awful like others say and the framerate of pokemon from far away is just bad but nothing bad when in battle or up close to them. Also wish that we could skip cutscenes like in SWSH cuz there is a LOT of dialog so if want to replay this game get ready to mash A through of the talking in the game. But even though the game has its problems they don't out weigh all of the good things in this game and I hope Game Freak takes the base of this game and expand on in it with good graphical features because this game to me is the best PokÃ©mon game so far.,01-Feb-22,9,0.909090909,1,1,0

Sei es die Geschichte, die ziemlich ausgeklÃ¼gelt ist, denn man landet in einer frÃ¼hen Version von Sinnoh aus PokÃ©mon Diamant und Perle. Kleiner Spoiler: Eigentlich kommt man aus der Zukunft und wenn man sich die kleinen Easter Eggs anschaut (Kleidung der Protagonisten zu Beginn des Spiels, dann der NPC ""Hin"" und die Manaphy Quest, welche eigentlich nur zu lÃ¶sen ist, wenn man PokÃ©mon Strahlender Diamant oder Leuchtende Perle gespielt hat), dann kommt man schnell auf den Trichter. Ansonsten ist vieles schÃ¶n umgesetzt. Ob es nun die PokÃ©mon-Weide statt der klassischen Boxen ist, die Tatsache, dass PokÃ©bÃ¤lle handgemachte GegenstÃ¤nde sind und alles eben in diese Zeit rein passt, oder die musikalische Untermalung einfach immer wieder an Diamant/Perle erinnert, alles passt einfach gut zusammen. Einzig kleinere Aufgaben nerven, wie die Kinoso-Nebenquest, wo man den Eintrag fÃ¼r Kinoso vervollstÃ¤ndigen muss, was aber nicht wie bisher durch einmaliges Fangen geschieht, sondern eben wie bei allen PokÃ©mon von bestimmten Kriterien abhÃ¤ngt, die man erfÃ¼llen muss, wie z.B. fange PokÃ©mon x mal/x mal unentdeckt, nutze diese und jene Attacke... Das kann, wenn die Spawnrate eines PokÃ©mon beschissen gering ist und von bestimmten zufÃ¤lligen Faktoren abhÃ¤ngt, nervig sein. Aber ansonsten ist dieser Titel gefÃ¼llt mit SpaÃ, das Jagen von Shinies macht mega viel SpaÃ dank der doch hohen Spawnraten (1/128 bei Massenbegegnungen mit Schillerpin), man hat auch einiges an Sammelkrams fÃ¼r lÃ¤ngere Nebenaufgaben, wie zum Beispiel Geisterlichter (107 StÃ¼ck auf 5 Welten verteilt), damit man am Ende Kryppuk fangen kann oder das Sammeln des kompletten Icognito-Alphabets. Was ich gut finde ist auch, dass man nicht mehr gezwungen ist, mit anderen Spielern zu tauschen, um ALLE Monster zu bekommen. SÃ¤mtliche durch Tausch erhÃ¤ltlichen Entwicklungen kann man nun nÃ¤mlich bequem mit den jeweiligen GegenstÃ¤nden entwickeln, zum Beispiel Metallmantel fÃ¼r Onix, um es zu Stahlos zu entwickeln. Machomei, Simsala, Gegner und Co erhÃ¤lt man nun, indem man bei Maschock, Kadabra, Gegner und Co die neu eingefÃ¼hrte ""Verbindungsschnur"" nutzt. Geile Idee! Auch die Bosse, die so genannten KÃ¶nige machen SpaÃ. Vergleichbar ist das mit dem System aus Sonne und Mond, wo man auch ein Bossmonster bekÃ¤mpfen musste. TrainerkÃ¤mpfe sind Ã¼brigens selten und beschrÃ¤nken sich auf relativ wenige Protagonisten aus dem Diamant-/Perl-Clan, und einigen anderen Charakzeren, die Ã¼brigens auch teilweise viel Ãhnlichkeit zu ihren Nachfahren der Sinnohregion aufweisen. PokÃ©mon Legenden Arceus ist ein richtig tolles Spiel. Ich bin jetzt nach rund 40 Stunden im fÃ¼nften Gebiet und hoffe sehr, dass wir fÃ¼r die Zukunft noch gute Inhalte bekommen und dass das Endgame an sich interessant wird. Bin ja noch nicht durch.",01-Feb-22,9,0.909090909,1,1,0

Tons to collect and the world feels massive! Not boring if your a PokÃ©mon fan. Game Freak really stepped up there game! (Pun intended) I would like to see all future PokÃ©mon games, using this as a template and continuing on, what was laid here. Please Game Freak, don?t go back to the old format!

541,"For me, this is the second best entry into the Pokemon series. Although, as a disclaimer, I've only played each of the mainline games and remakes (and Let's go, if that counts as a separate thing). Arceus has been my absolute favourite since I played Blue for the first time in the 90s and this new game was beaten out by nostalgia and fond memories only to be honest.The minimalistic art style is reminiscent of older Japanese artwork; it's a beautiful and moving take on simplistic world that supports the engaging core mechanics. It's true that it's not as beautiful as some more recent games, however for me it is clear that this is not what Arceus sets out to be.When we talk about open world games, the narrative often becomes about that world and the interactions with that world by the character and story; Arceus doesn't set out to have you move mountains within the world but instead exist as a part of a theorised greater whole. Much like the thesis of the game's story: how do we exist as humans within this greater world filled with potentially terrifying Pokemon who are by default stronger than we are? The game asks who are we compared to each other and who are we compared to these creatures, rather than who are we compared to the world. For me, the beauty is further than skin deep and the graphical minimalism of the world supports this greatly.Arceus gives a stage to often lesser used Pokemon, it asks you to think about your Pokemon journey further than 'Who is the strongest?', and it puts the exploration and mystery back in the genre.I loved it and I sincerely hope they produce more in this vein. Highly recommend.",02-Feb-22,9,0.666666667,1,1,0
542,"This Game. I love this Game, it's now my favorite PokÃ©mon game. I like, the world building and the chosen PokÃ©mon for the areas they are great and makes sense. Some people don't like that the PokÃ©mon have fixed spots where they can spawn, but I like it. That way, it isn't so difficult to fill the PokÃ©dex. I especially like that you need to do different things to complete the PokÃ©dex entree, it's refreshing new. At all, the new concept is something what PokÃ©mon really needed. This is the first important step. But hopefully not the last step. There are many things to improve. Especially the graphics and the distant view. But for people who don't care about graphics, only about the game-play, this is a great game. There aren't very much fights, but there are some, what I like. But this I can totally understand, this game plays in a time when it isn't so common that everyone has PokÃ©mon. The most fights are easy but sometimes there are hard fights especially in the after story. About the Boss PokÃ©mon of the games, I like that concept. Some of them are really easy, especially the first, but not all. Two of them were really hard and by one of them I have died two times. Which don't sound like much, but I play very much dark souls and in this game it is especially important to dodge, and the dodge role of PLA is exactly the same as there. During the role, you are for a short time invincible if you dodge exactly when the enemy is attacking. Overall I like this game, it is great and does very much fun.",02-Feb-22,9,0.666666667,1,1,0

547,"As a longtime fan I am very happy with this game. While it has it's flaws (mostly visuals and performance) it brings the series back to it's initial ideas and executes them well. The gameplay, while different, is very fun and incentivizes using every Pokemon. The Pokemon finally have a variety of animations that gives them each so much personality, I found myself liking Pokemon I never thought twice about before. The catching mechanics are great and while the new battle mechanics are not ideal for competitive, they are welcome changes to switch things up. If they took this formula, added online back into it and fixed up some things, it would be the perfect Pokemon game for me.",02-Feb-22,9,0.75,1,1,0
548,"My favourite PokÃ©mon game ever. Legends: Arceus feels so refreshing after all the incredibly linear PokÃ©mon games of the past. The wild area was a step in the right direction, but this is an entire leap. Some parts are still frustrating, like necessary 1v3 battles and repetitive star rank farming to progress, but even those aren't that bad. I can't think of anything off the top of my head that was added into this that is a noticeable downgrade from previous games.I completely understand why some people might not like this game, which is completely fine, but I want to make it clear that I'm not praising the game just because so is (mostly) everyone else. I went into this with very little information. I didn't watch trailers, or other content about this before it was released. I was not very hyped for this game before I played it, but I very much enjoyed the experience. The game has been stuck in my mind every time I'm unable to play it, it always sticks in the back of my head. Waiting to get back home to play this has turned into a tradition for me at this point.I'm not quite through this game yet, and I'm not a very critical person when it comes to media, but I still wanted to add my take on this. If you ask me, which you shouldn't, this game is definitely worth it. Especially if you're a PokÃ©mon fan.",02-Feb-22,9,0.75,1,1,0
549,"The game is very cool, My brother got it for me digitally and sure the tutorial is on the lengthy side but with the new mechanics its justified, the story is very cool and arceus (aka god) gives you a phone and i like how they have shiny pokemon spawn in the overworld with a sound to go with it, they even added something for the black and white fans, they added Ingo and even his subway like lines and I got a nice smile, they even added the subway theme and redid it which was a nice touch, this could be legends saving the remakes",02-Feb-22,9,0.75,2,2,0

555,"For everyone complaining about the visuals and graphics apparently don't remember that this game is coming at one of the most critically low points for Pokemon Co and Gamefreak.If the game is too graphical and has no substance, they are torn for laziness in gameplay. If the game has tons of content, but no graphics - they are torn for laziness in graphical fidelity.This game's graphics are - enough - to make this a highly successful look into what could become another mainline adventure game in the series.If you take the core component out of the game, the Pokemon, this is still a very well upheld adventure game in its own right.This game has so many FIRSTS for the series, it's unreal.This is the first Pokemon game where I feel like bringing the whole concept of Pokemon - GOTTA CATCH EM ALL - really is the idea that drives this game forward. This is the first game where I feel that Pokemon are actually magical, beautiful, and dangerous creatures. ""Never run into the tall grass without a Pokemon to defend you"" - the mantra that is hounded at the intro of EVERY SINGLE GAME TO THIS POINT is actually felt. Being chased by a LIGHTNING CAT would be absolutely terrifying if you were alone. This game makes you actually feel like you are one of the first people to tame a wild, weird, and wonderful world filled realistically with Pokemon.In short - Pokemon never has, and never will be, the pinnacle of graphical innovation - what this game does and shows is that you can have a whole lot of fun with being a lean, mean, Pokeball and food throwing machine - with enough world and graphics to satisfy the itch for a long time to come.",02-Feb-22,9,0.6,1,1,0

575,"FINALLY A FUN POKÃMON GAME! After years of stale games, PokÃ©mon finally changed their formula, and for the better. The concept may not sound too interesting at first, but building your own team has never been this fun. I?d even go as far as saying that the game gets better and better as you progress. Zones get bigger, PokÃ©mon get smarter, and you can finally assemble the team with the PokÃ©mon you want. I?ve always wanted an alakazam in my team and was limited by the outdated trade mechanic, but now I can finally use one! How refreshing. This game would be a 10/10 if it wasn?t for the graphics. I am especially disspointed by a certain aquatic zone that looks completely hideous and that I rushed through to get to the next zone. Luckily, the zone following was way better looking and fun. I also don?t like the water mechanic very much. I think it?s way less fun to go catch PokÃ©mon in the water than on land. The story is ok, nothing special but it?s not necessarily bad. No voice acting also kinda makes you cringe along the weird animations during the cutscenes. Some lag here and there but nothing that will alter the gameplay. The difficulty of the game is quite easy, (if sword and shield were a 1 and dark souls were a 10 this would be a 2 or 3) but you can also choose to fight PokÃ©mon that are much stronger than your team and try to catch them, which adds optional difficulty. Overall, amazing game, mediocre graphics considering BOTW had a similar style and looked miles better despite coming out 5 years prior.

585,"Siendo alguien que abandono la franquicia en la 5ta generaciÃ³n (una de las mejores de todas) decir que poder volver a disfrutar un pokemon no es poca cosa para mi.Este es el camino que tal vez pokemon tuvo que haber seguido hace tiempo, un mundo abierto donde realmente podes sentirte en conexiÃ³n con los pokemon e interactuar mas directamente con ellos mas allÃ¡ de solo los combates, con una mecÃ¡nicas muy simples pero bien implementadas que van de maravilla con lo que es la franquicia, aun siendo un spin off y no de la saga principal.Tiene fallas obviamente, el motor grafico es un insulto para los estÃ¡ndares actuales y a lo que la (comprobado con juegos como Zelda BOTW o Luigi Mansion 3) consola puede ofrecer, lo que lo hubiera vuelto mucho mas envolvente en lo visual en la experiencia, pero que tampoco interrumpe la fluidez del juego. La historia es otro punto que flaquea ,mas que todo hacia el final terminando de manera un poco abrupta sin darle casi nada de relevancia al pokemon con el nombre en el juego enfocÃ¡ndose mas al postgame, aunque sin dejar de ser lo suficientemente interesante como para seguir queriendo avanzar.Un titulo que falla bastante pero que tiene muchÃ­simo para mejorar y ofrecer si se lo trabaja como se debe, el cual Company puede explotar sin que afecte a la saga principal siendo Arceus un spin off que puede derivar en muchas entregas mas de este tipo, volviÃ©ndolo una saga. Yo espero que lo sea.Se da un punto de confianza para que se siga por este camino y cambio que la franquicia necesitaba.",17-Feb-22,9,0,11,11,8.7
586,"The game design is brilliant. It's probably the most fun I ever had playing through the game. The fast pace batlle and catch mechanics are the things the hold the idea together. If they were slow, it would be incredibly boring to complete the pokedex, but is quite enjoyable when you can't catch and battle in a matter of seconds, with no intro or unnecessary dialogue.For me, the fact that the game is not truly open world is not a negative. It would be nice to fly over all the regions? Yes. But it did't seem necessary.Completing the pokedex being the main goal of the game its great. I tried to play the game without looking for tips and managed to catch every regular mon -- minus Spiritomb and evolving some of them (more on this later). The thrill when I found Cleffa, Grotle and Munchlax -- 3 of the last 4 needed -- was one of the best in 30 years of playing videogames. I think 237 (or 242) is a decent number of pokemon to have in the game. The max they could have gone, I believe, is 300. More than that, would be a slog to get to Arceus.The last one I need was Cherubi, which I imagined that would be in one of the trees where you can find Cherrim (which I found two while going through the first part), but I delayed because it's kind boring going back to the village over and over again.The one negative thing I have to say about the pokedex/arceus mechanic is that is stupid to lock Arceus behind some mechanics that are almost impossible to find on your own. I killed the Overkqwil the game gives, so that's on me, but I would never find that you need to use the same mechanic 20x times. The same goes do Wyrdeer -- I'm not sure if you cand find it on the wild.But Ursaluna is the worst one. I tried every item, so by discarding the ones you use on other pokemon, I imagined you needed the peat block. But, for me, is insane you need to evolve during a full moon, which is quite rare. It's insane because 99% of players will need to check guides for it, which is bad. It's also impossible to find Manaphy if you don't have Diamond and Pearl, which I don't, but as it is not necessary to get to Arceus, it's ok.The Spiritomb mechanic, for me, it's ok. There is not a particular impossible wisp to find and, while doing the other stuff, I managed to find 93 out of 108. As I had done everything else and was clocking 70 hours, I decided to check a guide to get to Arceus. But, if you dedicate time to seach for them while doing other stuff, as I said, it's not bad.The research mechanic is good. While it gets boring by the end, the game makes you cycle your team and train almost every pokemon, which is a first for me in the franchise (usually plan my team ahead and use 6 to 9 max). And you can get to a 10 research level really fast with almost all of them. The few you don't, it's actually a nice challenge, because they are rarer pokemon and you need to make the most of every encounter you have.I'm not going through the mass outbreaks and distortions, but they are a nice change of pace and are very helpful to completing your dex.The bosses are major win. Simply battling a high level pokemon it's ok -- the Alpha mechanic makes some battles really tough --, but introducing a different approach made the game really fresh for me, and the battles were really tough and satisfying after I managed to get through. Palkia was a great boss battle and the one traditional trainer vs trainer you get in the end game was really nice. I understand that some people may wanted more trainer battles, but It didn't seem necessary for me.But, the best new thing is, easily, the riding mechanic. Switching Wyrdeer, basculegion and braviary is great. It's a very smooth experience and may very well be the best movement mechanic in video game history, not exaggerating. Being that good, the game never feels empty (I played almost all the praised triple A open world games and, even though there is much more on the screen, they usually have more boring parts). You never need to spend more than 10 seconds to get from pokemon A to B, which is great.",17-Feb-22,9,0,1,1,0

The new way of completing the PokÃ©dex make the process more interesting, compared to catching and forgetting about the PokÃ©mon. The graphics are a down side and need a lot of improvement. In my opinion graphics are less important when compared to gameplay. The part I don't like is the overuse of voiceless dialogue.

595,"as of writing this i have put over 50 hours into this game, finishing the main story, catching tons of pokemon and doing as many side quests i can and i must say i've nit been addicted to a game like this since i first played spider-man for the ps4. Legends arcues is in fact the definitive pokemon experience. As of recent the pokemon franchise has become very stale in it's games with so many half baked games, removal of fan favourite mechanics and some barely decent graphics. Arcues, while not the craziest game graphically legends is gonna save pokemon from further mediocrity. story is fun and quite interesting, while not mind blowing it will have genuine moments of surprise, excitement, sadness and fun. while some characters are quite stale the ones of any importance feel very genuine. game play is spectacular. this is the game (gamepley wise) is what we've wanted pokemon to become since we all played our first games. catching pokemon in the wild is extremely rewarding. Battles are fun with agile style and string style being a fun integration and something i wish would become apart of the mainline series as i found it to genuinely change up the fights, with getting more chances to attack after another exhilarating and your opponent attacking multiple times is while enraging you know most time it's something you could have avoided with the right tactics. The graphics are pretty good. All round the world is fun and nice however a clash of artistic stylisation and over all world building causes things to become flat and lesser than intended. the glitches too, while i've only experienced one i fell that mentioning of glitches is needed in this review as some have reported man glitches being a common occurrence for them and so all who read this should be cautious of such. Legends arceus is the direction pokemon is heading. While it isn't the main series of games, im hopeful that aspects of this game go into the main games and i'm excited to see more regions in the past, my most anticipated being a legends game set in Kalos, Galar and Unova would be the most incredible ones to play in my opinion. if you want this game, get it. if you ever want to get into pokemon or come back to it. Buy this game. while there is issues, to me in no way do these affect the overall grand experience too much other than when i get stuck in the water once lol",21-Feb-22,9,0,1,1,0

605,"Loving this game. I?m about 8 and a half hours in. Not going to give any spoilers but the game does get funner and you?re able to travel more and faster as you play. I was really considering trading/selling this game after my first two hours. The reason for an 8 and not a perfect score is simply due to the unnecessary dialogue in the game which gets very annoying as you?re just trying to go out there to explore and catch/level up your PokÃ©mon. I understand it?s part of the story, but they could have limited all the text saving me from mashing the a/b button and skimming through it. I?m not trying to sit there for an hour reading through what the NPC has to say for a certain quest. It would have been better if there was some sort of voice acting which would actually bring interest in the story. Aside from this, game is really fun and rewarding just like older PokÃ©mon games. Love the battling as it adds a bit more strategy now with agile/strong moves. Catching PokÃ©mon is also quite fun and provides some sort of achievement in catching the same PokÃ©mon more than once. Could have been a perfect game. It?s still the best PokÃ©mon game released on the Switch.",26-Feb-22,8,1,14,15,6.1
606,"I'm really conflicted on this game. It has a lot of negatives to it - missing PokÃ©mon held back for DLC, meaningless characters, dull story, absolutely abysmal graphics when docked and played on a TV. These are all issues that'd kill on the spot 99% of games, and yet... I absolutely love PokÃ©mon Legends: Arceus. I'm just unsure as to whether it's for objective reasons, or extremely subjective ones.So yes, while all the above negatives are true, the gameplay loop of real time catching of PokÃ©mon a la the 'Let's Go' series, combined with battling and a moderately increased difficulty level, improving on elements introduced in Sword and Shield, makes the actual moment to moment experience extremely satisfying. As a PokÃ©mon fan, this is what I've been waiting for since I first played Blue in the 90s. But that's where the subjectivity comes in, because I think I'd be much more critical if I'd never heard of PokÃ©mon and went into this game 'fresh'.Game Freak deserve praise for taking chances and moving the franchise in an exciting new direction, but it really needs to be stressed just how bad this game actually looks. I'm all for gameplay over visuals, but there's a line in the sand where it just comes across as downright lazy from the developers. There's no excuse for the terrible textures that would make a Gamecube title blush - one particular scene at a volcano is almost vomit inducing in how choppy the textures are. This isn't an indie studio; this is a multi-million dollar franchise that can and should be doing better, even with the Switch's hardware taken into consideration.Other aspects of the game, such as the invincibility frame 'dodge and roll', Dark Souls Lite boss battles and the tacked on crafting system, there simply to give more purpose to the 'open world' (inverted commas much needed here, as it's not really an open world as such) are so-so - not offensively bad or fantastically brilliant - and represent an opportunity to move the series forward more in the future. I missed the gym battle system as well to be honest, and hope that makes a return in future games.Flaws aside, this is the best/freshest PokÃ©mon title since probably Platinum, 14 years ago. It can be markedly improved (honestly, I don't remember the name of a single character and I finished playing half an hour ago; truly awful) but the strength of its' gameplay loop is enough to give it a hearty recommendation and definitely enough to get me excited about future games in the franchise.",14-Feb-22,8,0,164,165,6.1

612,"This has got to be the most fun I have had with a Pokemon game in many, many years. Here is some background for anyone who cares. I got Pokemon Yellow after I played a little of Red my cousin loaned me. I loved it and played though it 3 times. I was young and stupid and had erased the game by mistake a few times because I wanted to experience the beginning of the game. I played a little of Silver before my friend wanted his copy back. When Diamond and Pearl came out on the DS I got back in the series after I had taken time away from it for a while. I Enjoyed Pearl and had completed the game in a week and played it for a few more. Then I tried playing the games that came after. I played through Black and had some fun. I couldn?t even get myself to finish Black 2. I played and beat Y over a weekend and didn?t touch it again. Sun was boring and I never finished, Let?s Go Pikachu, it was fun but couldn?t hold my old man attention. I gave up on Sword because it was a massive let down and after being someone who started playing the series in 2000 I was just kinda done with the repetitiveness of the franchise. So when I say it?s the most fun I have had with a Pokemon game in a long time, it?s not for lack of trying. Even though I never touch Y after that weekend, I always intended to return to it. Because I enjoyed it??At any rate this isn?t a franchise review it?s a review of the new game. A game that is has me thinking about it when I?m not playing it. A game that got me to roll out of bed on the eve of my 35th birthday and toss loads of hours into it and talk endlessly to my wife about it when I wasn?t playing. The only reason I won?t rate this game over an 8 is there are still problems with it. These problems don?t mean I don?t love the, because I do. It relaxes my mind in it?s repetition, it also frustrates me with that very repetitive nature. The fact that I have spent hours working with one Pokemon and still haven?t completed it?s dex entry highlights a massive shortcoming with the game. Most things need to be repeated 20 to 25 times and that?s a bit excessive in my book. As much as I love this game I'm not sure I?ll ever finish a single Dex entry. Also the story, while good, feels like it?s bulked out by characters repeating the same few story points over and over. To a point that when it happens I just kinda skip the dialogue until something new is being said. I don?t need to read where I have come from and what I did 6 hours ago over and over ad nauseam. On that the tutorial in this game is horribly long and handholding. Then we get to the graphics??oh boy, the graphics??I honestly don?t care. They look fine for the most part. Sure there is a bit of clipping here and there. Water and grass can look a bit outdated, but I really, really don?t care. I often find it beautiful to look at and while I think they could have done better or perhaps hid the graphics behind cell shading like BotW did I?m fine with them. I enjoy the game and at the end of the day that is what I?m looking for in a video game: enjoyment. I have played way too many games with stunning visuals and no substance whatsoever. I have played games with awesome stories but horrible controls that force me to stop. I just want fun and I find this game very fun, even when it?sa bit tedious.",29-Jan-22,8,0.849056604,1,2,0

Don't get me wrong it has it's flaws, but finally Gamefreak listened and tried something new and we should at least give them credit for that and let them know that the change and direction of the game is good.It is a great foundation of what is to come.So what could be better and should be addressed either for a new game or even DLC:-The graphics, obviously-more diverse Pokemon behaviour-more rich open world, with more interesting viewpoints-sorting options for the Pokemon boxes-maybe biulding villages from the groundup in the wild (like Taburasa in Breath of the Wild), as kind of a way to tame the wildernessThe gameplayloop just feels very rewarding and it's so much fun.

616,"It's Breath of the Wild meets Pokemon, but with a bit of Monster Hunter mixed in.And I love it! This is the closest we've been to an open-world Pokemon game that I've daydreamed about since I was a kid. Arceus delivers Pokemon Snap- levels of environmental immersion as a mainline RPG -- you will encounter pokemon walking/swimming/flying around in their natural habitats instead of randomly encountering something while blindly walking through tall grass. You can summon your own pokemon to gather berries, mine shards, and engage a wild pokemon all within a few steps without waiting for flow-stopping animations and transitions. It's truly like playing a simulation of the anime.Issues that I had: Most bothersome to me might be the fact that you have to fast travel back to the hub city in order to go to the next zone (like Monster Hunter). It makes the world feel a lot smaller since it's just a bunch of disconnected environments instead of a huge continent. Also, no mounts at the hub city makes traveling a drag. Now for my minor issues. Some of the sound effects are clearly ripped from BotW, such as the male character sounding exactly like Link when he tucks and rolls. Maybe it was meant to be a callback, but personally I wish they didn't recycle assets like that. The graphics are also a little rough around the edges here and there. Some things like rocks and trees disappear if you slightly turn the camera. And the game sometimes draws pokemon at its max spawn distance, but animates them at like 2 FPS which makes them look bizarre against the more smooth and lively world closer to you. If the hardware is struggling to do this, just don't draw the pokemon that far!Anyways, I'd give this a 8 out of 10. Rough around the edges in parts, but this is definitely a Pokemon formula I want them to polish and perfect. I don't think I'll be able to stomach the old style of pokemon games again. If Nintendo can somehow cram in a more modern setting with pokemon centers, cities, (etc) AND open world pokemon walking about onto the little Switch cartridge, it'd be absolutely perfect. It may be possible that the Switch may not have the horsepower to truly get to the next level, though.",30-Jan-22,8,0.828571429,9,9,6.7

(Not a modern Jhoto nor ancient Jhoto, regular gen 2 Jhoto couple of cities multiple towns with huge routes to catch pokemon), Still playing the game haven't fully captured all legendaries and i'm at 72 hours but already finished main story and post game story only missing secondary missions.

I went yesterday to my local store to buy Monster Hunter Rise and then when I was paying they told me if I also wanted to take Pokemon: Acreus that it had released a couple of days back. Personally never played a Pokemon game before and thought to give it a try. My first impression was not good, to be honest (and the reason for knocking a couple of points form the score) is that the graphics and presentation are bad for a 2022 released game. Lets be honest, it felt like a game released in a previous gen. Music is also very very generic and just serviceable as well as the sound effects. Having said that I just kept playing and the game has some special charm, the controls are good the environments are ok but its great to see the little Pokemon just running around and doing stuff and you trying to capture them or battle them. So far , I am hooked, its definitely an enjoyable game and now I want to level and use all the pokemons that I have captured. Honestly its a good game with terrible graphics, but you kind of get used to them. I havent even had time to open Monster Hunter Rise nor finish Metroid Dread.

I feel that this game represents a significant leap for PokÃ©mon as a whole, drawing us closer to the PokÃ©mon game that we?ve always dreamed of. The game is not without its graphical issues, however they aren?t significant enough to hamper the gameplay. Overall I would certainly recommend this game to those looking for an open-world PokÃ©mon experience.Things I Like:??Open World??Catching and battling PokÃ©mon on-the-fly??Battles occur in the environment, not in arenasThings I Don?t Like:??Unfinished feeling to the graphics with low quality textures and aggressive pop-in,??Star progression can feel like a grind at times",31-Jan-22,8,0.84,3,3,0

De todas formas este aspecto, a mi ver (Esto ya depende de cada persona), no afecta a la experiencia de juego.Para ser un juego de mundo abierto (aunque este sub dividido en varias zonas es prÃ¡cticamente de mundo abierto) el juego tiene muy pocos Bugs, algo muy difÃ­cil de lograr en este tipo de juegos, siendo el Ãºnico bug que me he encontrado un Gyarados volador (Que segÃºn me dicen algunos, no es un bug...).El juego tambiÃ©n tiene ciertos detalles que me gustan, como que el personaje se va manchando con el barro o mojando cuando llueve o que el asentamiento principal del juego vaya creciendo y cambiando por tus acciones segÃºn vas avanzando.A mi ver este juego es muy divertido y se merece un 8, siendo estÃ¡ nota asÃ­ por su falta de pulimento grÃ¡fico.",29-Jan-22,8,0.828571429,5,13,5.5
626,"Game Freak finally tried this time.This was a major step in the right direction for the franchise after decades of stagnation. So far I have put roughly 16 hours into the game and am still loving it; the novelty of catching and battling Pokemon in an open world setting still feels fresh after all these hours and I can see myself playing this game for hundreds of hours. I have played every single Pokemon game since the original Diamond and Pearl and I can confidently say that this is the best Pokemon game I have played in a long time - Game Freak have finally managed to make the Pokemon game we've all wanted since we were kids.The Pros:-Gameplay is better than ever and fits seemlessly in an open world.-Gameplay loop is addicting and rewarding.-Feels like a more mature game with a higher difficulty.-Maps only get better after the first area.-Ambience music is beautiful and immersive.The Cons:-Graphics could have been better if the game was given just a few more months.-AI is better than Sword and Shield - but still has a long way to go.-Story is bland.Starting with the negatives: the game is rough around the edges and if Game Freak's games weren't rushed, they could have taken a few more months to polish it and make it look even better. This goes for the AI too, as Pokemon are often just sitting around doing nothing. Luckily, depending on the Pokemon they will react differerntly to seeing you - some will get aggressive and chase you, some will run away from you, and some won't care at all. Unfortunately, even the most aggressive Pokemon are extremely easy to run away from and don't present much of a threat. It is certainly a step-up from the lifeless Pokemon AI from Sword and Shield, but with a second entry I hope to see Pokemon acting uniquely within their own habitats similar to Pokemon Snap. Lastly, I found myself ignoring a lot of the main story as I couldn't get engaged with it, and preferring to explore and do side-quests instead.While the graphics, AI, and storytelling could use some improvement, it's apparent that Game Freak spent a lot more time on the more important aspect of this game: the gameplay. Gameplay is king in Legends Arceus and it's easily the most addicted I've been to a Pokemon game since I was a kid. Everything is very seemless in the open world setting as they finally ditched the time-consuming and dated battle screens and loading screens in between areas. This game feels like it actually belongs on the Switch - unlike the awfully-outdated Sword and Shield. The game loop is very addicting as you go into the open fields to collect resources to craft items which will help you on your journey as you catch as many Pokemon as you can to complete your Pokedex. Most importantly, Pokemon has long suffered from the criticism that it's too easy - while this game isn't hard by any stretch, it does feel like the game has matured for older audiences quite a bit. I've noticed Pokemon battles are usually a lot more difficult as the game no longer warns you which Pokemon your opponent is sending out beforehand, and the AI generally seems to be a lot smarter when attacking you - my Pokemon got knocked out frequently.The first area (Obsidian Fieldlands) is a bit bland and may not be the best first impression for gamers, but fortunately after the first area, the maps get significantly more interesting. The biomes change to swamplands, to coastlands, to clifflands, to snowy mountains - all with unique ways to traverse them as the game continuously gives you new Pokemon to help you get around. The music adds a key element to what makes exploring so much fun, the ambience music in this game is beautiful and adds just that extra bit of immersion when exploring. Especially for players of Diamond and Pearl (or even the remakes) the music is often remixed versions of the old soundtracks of Sinnoh, and visiting old places and seeing them realized in an open world (such as the lakes) makes for a very nostalgic throwback.All in all, the closest Switch games I can compare this to is a mix between Breath of the Wild, and Monster Hunter Rise. It has the style and presentation of the former, with the addicting gameplay mechanics similar to the latter. This game is a strong 8/10 and I pray that Game Freak keeps this new formula and expands to it - it would be very disappointing to see them go back to the old style of games after this.",01-Feb-22,8,0.909090909,9,10,7

640,"Many long term fans will agree that the last time we got a exceptionally great pokemon experience was when Black 2 and White 2 were released. After that, while the games were far from bad back then, they never quite reached the same heights. Enter: 2019. Pokemon Sword and Shield were a desaster. They were a rushed product devoid of any meaningful content to the point were it felt downright cynical. It continued to be a massive commercial success. To me, it was the point were I gave up any hope of ever having another good pokemon experience. What I didn't expect was that Game Freak would then do a complete 180 and deliver... this! A game, definitely flawed, but that you can tell they were really passionate about! Do the graphics suck? Big time. But what this game does provide is a highly addicting feedback loop, immersive ways to catch and interact with pokemon, an interactable overworld, crafting, epic optional boss battles, ability based progression, a well contextualized side quest system, a worthwhile story etc. If this is the future of the franchise, then my gosh, my prayers have been heard, pokemon is saved, and I couldn't be happier!tl;dr: **** great!",15-Feb-22,8,0,51,51,8.4
641,"If you're looking for the greatest PokÃ©mon game ever made, PokÃ©mon Legends: Arceus is not it. While the game is very fun and refreshing, like all of the games before it, it eventually grows to feel too repetitive and unfun. The gameplay loop is to gather resources, catch PokÃ©mon, complete research tasks, and repeat. This gameplay loop, for the first 15 hours or so, is very fun and addicting, but by the end of the game, it does not feel as if there is enough variety within the core loop to keep you engaged. Likewise, the side quests in the game are pretty typical and unengaging, which is a huge bummer for those of us who like to complete a game's extra content. The boss battles in the game are super fun - while you still battle in these fights, you also have to, as a trainer, dodge enemy attacks in an almost bullet-hell like way. Although they aren't too difficult, they add a change of pace to the game's main loop and rewards players for thinking on their feet.

For a first real departure from its standard all of its flaws are acceptable. Gameplaywise I hope the new mechanics will get improved on and will be implemented in future iterations of the mainline series. However, Game Freak and Nintendo should also improve on their lazy graphics and level design for their future games, because those are a huge disappointment and are unacceptable for any AAA game in 2022 and onward.

645,"As someone who's played Pokemon since gen 1 as a kid, I wanted to see how this new installment stood up to previous ones as well as my opinion as a lifelong Pokemon fan.The short version is this: I enjoyed it, even with a few criticisms. I had fun, and I actually did Catch 'em All this time.The long version is: It's a new and interesting direction for Pokemon to go, having done the usual 8 badges + beat evil team for 25 years. Although the catchphrase implied you had to indeed catch them all, it was never the main goal. If you did, you rarely got anything good unless you were shiny hunting, and it was really just for the sake of doing it. So to make that the goal of getting the true final ending of this game was innovative and unique. They took away the pressure of the main path to follow and instead put a lot of focus on discovering all the Pokemon in the region. It also did a good job of making the wild Pokemon feel more dangerous and not just pests.Now for the downsides... I didn't encounter a lot, but the things I did see are the most commonly talked about. Mainly the graphics. I'm not a big whiner about it, but it was definitely a bit rough sometimes. Mostly when high up, as when you're on the ground catching or battling Pokemon it's harder to see. However, I didn't find that it ruined my experience of playing it. There were also some encounters that were frustrating, involving chasing really fast Pokemon that dashed away as soon as you were in their line of sight. As well, one battle in particular was a huge difficulty spike over any others and was really imbalanced in favor of the opponent. Kids are supposed to be able to play this, and it gave me a rough time, so I can't imagine how much one might struggle against it. Also, multibattles exist but you still only get to use one Pokemon, so you can easily find yourself getting wombo combo'd to death with nothing you can do but watch.Basically, it's definitely a good game at its core, but could use some polish. If they go this route again in the future, I hope they listen to criticism of this one to better balance the next one.If you weren't sure about getting this one, I'll say this: If you're a committed Pokemon fan, you won't want to miss it. If you're just looking to play the hot new game and really want pretty graphics, you may want to skip it if you just can't accept how it looks. It's not perfect, but it's good.",18-Feb-22,8,0,1,1,0

651,"If you love pokemon but wanted a fresh take on the series, this will make you happy and give you a lot of meat to chew on. The music, when it's there, is very nice in my opinion. I'd describe a lot of it as ""mystical"" or ""dreamlike"". The battle themes, however, seem less varied compared to past titles, as I can't recall more than 1 or 2 different themes throughout the main storyline. The main story is more or less typical pokemon filler, meaning it's the bare minimum you would need to call it a story and exists mostly to get you from point A to B. Some of the characters have nice designs, and there are ideas and concepts peppered throughout that caught my interest, but all in all the story is in itself quite bland and lifeless. Unfortunate, but not surprising. The game does not always look great, or even good, in terms of graphics. If you expected something that's consistently beautiful and polished, you'll be let down. The bulk of my reasoning for an 8/10 review score is the gameplay, which, depending on what you enjoy doing in open world style games, will either make or break the game for you. The alpha pokemon, the new battle/ catching system, and the exploration and gathering/crafting all scratch an itch for me. It feels fluid, fun, and satisfying to wander around doing these things in tandem. While the world itself is on the empty side and leaves much to be desired, there's enough out there to keep me wanting to explore. The pokedex research will put off some people who are more into the series for the competitive aspects, there is a lot of it and it is required up to a certain point. For people like myself who like to relax and wander without worrying too much about building a top tier smogon team and plowing through the battle tower, it's not going to deter me from enjoying the more laid back aspects of the game. Arceus Legends is a very important and positive step forward in the series. If they choose to keep going this way and learn from their mistakes, they could very easily create not only the best pokemon game ever one day, but one of the best open world games ever one day. They're far from that point with Legends, but I've enjoyed it immensely as a pokemon fan of more than 20 years.",30-Jan-22,8,0.837837838,2,2,0
652,"Simultaneously the best and most embarassing thing Gamefreak has ever released. A fantastic 10/10 game bundled in a very obviously underdeveloped package. The PokÃ©mon models and animations look great, but the world itself looks like an early progress shot I would see an indie game dev share on twitter. It's laughable how bad the game looks in some areas, especially most caves and in dark areas (where the background will literally warp around your character like you're poorly greenscreened in). I have many other gripes, such as the story pacing (a lot of dialogue scenes either need to be cut shorter or be more interesting. Voice acting would've helped). But otherwise the game is honestly fantastic. My favourite PokÃ©mon experience to date. I just wish it came out like a year later so it would have all the development time it needed. I would love this style of game to continue and be iterated on, it's a major improvement over the old formula; having a game like this with more settlememts to explore and more complex side quests, etc would be a dream. Also thank god that they only released one version.",01-Feb-22,8,0.916666667,2,2,0
653,"This was a necessary experiment for the PokÃ©mon franchise, and it was executed fairly well. Most importantly, I think it laid a solid foundation for future sequels that will build on the formula. The game focuses entirely on the single player experience, which is where it differs the most from other games in the series. So there is no battling other human players, and minimal interaction with others, and this is entirely by design. The game serves as a prequel to the PokÃ©mon franchise, so the areas you explore are very empty due to them being underdeveloped. This definitely gives the series a long desired sense of exploration and adventure. I?m not a huge fan of PokÃ©mon games, I played several of them, but skipped out on others if I just wasn?t in the mood. That formula has not changed in 25 years, so this a very welcome change of pace, while still keeping the core spirit of the PokÃ©mon universe. The gameplay loop feels much like (early) PokÃ©mon Go, where the main objective is just to explore and catch all of the PokÃ©mon. It?s a pleasant game to explore, however the gameplay loop does get a little repetitive so I found myself taking a lot of breaks, but I would I regularly return to it. It has that Breath of the Wild atmosphere which is very relaxing - minimal music in the wild, only ambient nature noises, the music is all very soft piano, and vast open spaces. I also appreciate that they added some substance to the story, granted it?s nothing to go crazy about, but it provides a welcome change of pace to ?beat all the gym leaders and get their badges to become the best??that we have been provided for the past 25 years. The graphics aren?t as bad as people make them out to be, but they definitely aren?t impressive. I almost feel like if they weren?t able to do high quality graphics, whether it?s cartoon or realistic, the game would have looked better with some degree of artistic design - maybe watercolor impressions, or anything really, because the graphics do damper the sense of exploration a little bit. Overall it?s a fun game I can see myself taking my time to play through because it?s just a relaxing experience. Everything is solid, the effort is exceptional, but it laid that groundwork for future sequels which can truly be fantastic games. I can definitely tell you this is far more exciting than any possible new generation of PokÃ©mon they could introduce, and probably one of the most memorable PokÃ©mon experiences in the last 15 years.",29-Jan-22,8,0.844827586,48,48,7.4

655,"I had rock bottom expectations for this game up until the leaks if we?re being honest here. If you ever plan on playing/buying this game, do NOT watch anything Nintendo or PokÃ©mon put out before the release date because the marketing did such a terrible job selling this game. But given Game Freak?s track record of the last decade, I?m shocked they were able to pull this off. Being a PokÃ©mon fan in the last decade has been rough, ORAS was awesome & Sun/Moon were good too despite repeated playthroughs making me sour on them a lot, but everything else has been just short of a trainwreck. Gen 6 was the definition of lazy repetition aside from bringing everything to 3D, US/UM was the laziest rerelease I think of all time, the Let?s Go games were yet another unnecessary remake of the awful & boring Gen 1, we all know how bad Sword & Shield were despite their DLCs doing it a slight bit of justice & BDSP finally showed a lot of fans how much passion for this series has been lost by falling flat on their faces trying to ?remake??their best games, they?re more of a remaster than a remake. But let?s get into it, Legends Arceus is a fantastic game & it?s THE breath of fresh air that we?ve needed for YEARS now. I might just have recent bias now but I wouldn?t mind if they didn?t make a main series game for a long time if it meant more games like Legends! Negatives first, the elephant in the room since this game got revealed were the god awful graphics & I can say they definitely touched it up quite a bit since then, but it still just looks plain bad. Like I?m playing a PS2 game in 2022, yikes. Immersion breaking graphics in your billion dollar franchise is inexcusable when this console has given us Breath of the Wild & Mario Odyssey, LEARN HOW TO OPTIMIZE YOUR GAMES ALREADY! There?s no reason that every previous Switch PokÃ©mon game looks better than this one. The pop-in is so bad too, sometimes things just spawn right behind you or in front of you as you?re running around & it can get annoying when you want to catch a rare PokÃ©mon that?s been giving you the slip. Also the button layout is really weird in Legends, to the point that almost 40 hours in I?m still hitting the wrong buttons when trying to open the map or open the bag to heal my PokÃ©mon. Why is Y dodge?? Also made my hands cramp up a lot after long play sessions, PLEASE put out a patch where we can change the button layout. The Braviary flying feature needs work too. Why is there no accent button?! Having to take back off again & again after SLOWLY landing in these huge open areas is so??dumb. I think the biggest flaw aside from optimization is the lack of any voice acting. It was awkward in more recent games but never as awkward as in Legends. This game truly needed it, so many of the big story moments DESERVED more than a text box with that annoying ass boom sound effect.But there?s also so much this game does right, catching PokÃ©mon & completing the PokÃ©dex has never felt better & will never feel the same in the slow mainline games ever again after this. Despite some PokÃ©mon being annoyances to get, at least I didn?t have to shell out an extra $60 for a 2nd identical version just for 10 PokÃ©mon they didn?t put in my game lol. The new boss battles are incredible too, actually fighting a PokÃ©mon ON FOOT? I swear I had fever dreams about a game like this when I was a kid. I feel like the only person who didn?t black out during the story, Returnal has conditioned my reflexes to dodge effortlessly I guess. The wide open areas are all distinct & a ton of fun to explore, I actually really loved the Wild Areas in Sword & Shield so knowing this is what they had up their sleeve, bravo. Just wishing they looked like a 2022 game. The story, in true PokÃ©mon fashion, is very lowkey up until the end as always, but this time I actually felt something! I was hurt, I was stunned at the stakes the story established, & the whole time I was filled with nostalgia feeling like a kid again. Impeccable line to walk there & that deserves a lot of praise! Just talking & thinking about it fills me with a childlike joy that has been gone for so long with PokÃ©mon. It?s even got a fair bit of challenge in the new pretty good battle system, who woulda thought? Of course a lot of these positives have small quirks I didn?t jive with 100% of the time, but Legends Arceus is an amazing foundation to build sequels off of that will (hopefully) perfect it?s formula. At the end of the day, the damage previous games have done to my love & trust of Game Freak & PokÃ©mon may never go away, but this game has done the impossible of giving me hope for the franchise again, I truly think this is a turning point for the franchise & I hope they go full speed ahead & never look back. 8.5/10",01-Feb-22,8,1,65,65,7.5

This is the first pokemon game created in a style that is vastly different from previous titles and maintained the pokemon ""feel"" while making sweeping changes to the overall gameplay loop.Pros: Very fresh take on the formula, more action based gameplay, sacrifices very little in terms of staple game mechanics, good pokedex selection, a catching mechanic that stokes envy from the lets go games, varying and noticeable size differences in the pokemon that makes each catch that much more unique, a serviceable plot, much more streamlined ""Competitive"" building of pokemon that only requires a pokemon to be fed certain items, decent post game content, being able to summon all your pokemon at once in order to chill/ interact with them, interesting options for traversal, new pokemon forms to play with, decent in-game economy encourages catching pokemon and collecting items, and enraged pokemon are huge and fun to capture.Cons: Not having multiplayer is a shame given how fun the single player content is, the levels are large but there's not a whole lot to see in them, the appeal of the ""open world"" wears off towards the end of the game when all traversal mechanics are unlocked, the graphics aren't that great, not enough trainer battles, in my opinion the new pokemon forms are pretty ugly design-wise (decidueye) except for a few (arcanine, typhlosion), and, again in my opinion, the boss pokemon catching minigame could have been much more fleshed out - it just wasn't that interesting and felt a bit tacked on to me but I feel it is a step in the right direction.I had loads of fun playing arceus and was genuinely thankful that gamefreak not only shook up the formula immensely but managed to get so many things right on the first try. None of the cons I listed above stopped me from enjoying the game from start to finish. Its far from a perfect experience, but it is an experience that gets me very excited for future ""legends"" titles.",20-Feb-22,8,0,5,5,8
657,"The game is not perfect but as a starting pokÃ¨mon game which tries to be more open man does its good work. Catching and exploring without limitation is fun and reading about Hisui's hidden lore has been quite fun. The problem comes when you try to explore for longer times and the graphic holds you off a little, but it is manegable. Overall good but GF should really take more time on games",29-Jan-22,8,0.844827586,4,8,8
658,"Overall PLA is a great game that brings a lot of innovation (a huge understatement) and a more lively atmosphere. Plus it has a good amount of game time for someone to play (25-35 hours and up to 75 to complete everything). Plus it is overall well polished as I haven't seen any reports of major bugs or glitches and the PokÃ©mon/attacks look amazing.However, it has a lot of downsides. The newer PokÃ©mon designs in the game should've been thought out longer in general (I say this as someone who likes around 97% of all PokÃ©mon designs). The visuals are bad obviously, but personally I don't care about this as I would've played a PS5 game if I did. The story is...well..what you would expect from a kid's game. Nothing groundbreaking or offensive. My biggest and arguably my only real complaint, is that there isn't that much gameplay variety. You simply just battle and catch a certain amount of PokÃ©mon, use moves a certain amount of times and do the ""boss battle"" attacking. This is all rather cool, but as explained, it needs a bit more in order to keep me invested. Also the national dex is small and the multi-player is nonexistent. This sounds like a lot of complaining but I am just trying to be as clear as possible about the flaws.So should you buy it? It honestly depends on the person which I know sounds like a cop out, but this is the truth. If you want something that breaks free from the PokÃ©mon formula no matter what:Yes buy it. If you're one of those people that complain endlessly about Breath of the Wild being Empty:Don't think about it. If you're one of those people that are strict and will be annoyed about things not being in the game from before:don't think about it. If you're someone who loves playing around with PokÃ©mon and in the surroundings:Yes you will love it. Either way, I wouldn't worry too much whether you made a bad purchase or not as you'll still be able to have some fun.",29-Jan-22,8,0.805555556,5,5,7.6

663,"This is the best Pokemon game Ive ever experienced. They have defiantly have taken some inspiration from Breath of the Wild and have listened to the fans. Sword and Shield was a joke. After ten minuets of that game I hated it but this is totally different. There isn't enough hours in the day to play this.I grew up with Pokemon. I watched the series, some of the movies, played Blue, Gold, Crystal, Ruby and unfortunately Shield. Those games had something new to them in each iteration. Gold had a better progression system. There isn't a huge jump in power levels like there is in Blue. Ruby is probably the tightest Pokemon game I played for a while but when Shield came out I was expecting what Arceus is offering here but we got a rehash of what we've been getting for the last 20 years.This game looks like its in early development or its a proof of concept. Its poor and they need to get some high level talent at Nintendo to bring this to the next level. But the pokemon look good and the moves look even better. It leaves me confused how doing up some environmental textures could be so hard. The lighting is fine but its more a texture issue. The environment doesn't really match the style of the pokemon. Its odd. And you dont really have a sense where you are cause its all kinda samey. Unless your near a waterfall or a beach or something you can use as some kind of landmark. This needs improvements but we're close to getting that game we always wanted.As for gameplay wise its pretty good. I have little issue with the gameplay. Its still turn based and you share exp but its harder still. The pop in and pop out is ridiculous. You could be chasing down a pokemon and then all of a sudden POP it goes away. This needs fixing. In the early 00's its fine but not anymore. The lack of or more the point, the absence of voice over is jarring. Still stuck in the 90's with the text for speech. Pokemon is one of the biggest franchises in the world, they have enough for a voice over budget.Im giving this an EIGHT cause I'm so happy playing this. It has plenty of issues that it really should be a SIX but the nostalgia is strong with this one.",08-Feb-22,8,0.666666667,22,23,6.7

I am not giving it a 10 because I feel there were alot of things they could do with the graphics, goddammit it just needs a bit of polishing, maybe some more cool minigames, different mysteries and wuests that You can randomly find in the wild, that would be amazing.

Si tÃº, que aÃºn no compras el juego, lees una de esas crÃ­ticas negativas donde consideran a Pokemon Sword & Shield mejor que este juego, no te puedes tomar para nada en serio esa crÃ­tica. Pokemon Sword & Shield es una oda al facilismo, insultantemente fÃ¡cil, una de las peores entregas de la saga Pokemon y que hizo que la Nintendo Switch estÃ© en deuda con los fans.Habiendo aclarado esto, el Pokemon Arceus empieza lento por un tutorial tan extenso que nos puede tomar hasta 3 horas completar.

676,"Fun game. Didn't blow my mind, but it definitely laid the groundwork for a future game that could. It doesn't surpass the experience I had playing the gen 1-3 games as a kid, but the shake-ups to the formula were, for me, just enough for the series to feel fun again for the first time in over a decade.The game's visuals seem to be the most common complaint but I don't really see it. Gamefreak have never exactly been masters of aesthetic quality and I'm fine with that. But it looks passable to me, sometimes even pleasant. Roaming around the village the first couple hours reminded me a bit of the Utawarerumono series. The main zones did start to become pretty drab after a while but they didn't make a poor first impression on me. Terrain textures don't matter to me, they could have made them flat colors for all I care. The mesh LOD pop-in is a much bigger problem.The big things I liked about the game:-The main gameplay loop is fun. Going out of my way to fill out the pokedex and earn new stars never got boring to me.-As someone who likes JRPGs but is tired of encounters random or otherwise, this new approach to pokemon battles feels nice. Starting and ending battles feels seamless, and if a battle isn't going my way I can quite literally just turn around and walk away. Love it.-The effort level system, while it's not without drawbacks, makes the game more challenging. The EV system from the mainline pokemon games rewards you just for sticking with a pokemon long term by effectively giving them massive stat modifiers. In this game my main never felt invincible until I went out of my way to max out their ELs. Though it does feel kinda gamey compared to EVs, especially the process of levelling them. But it's just nice to actually be able to see the numbers now.-Each pokemon has an inventory of moves now, and you can swap them in and out of the four in use whenever you want. I like this a lot better than the way it works in the mainline games.-There's an item that lets you evolve pokemon you would otherwise need to trade to evolve. As a guy who never really cared for the trading thing, I appreciated this a lot.-Mounts are very cool (but some more than others)All my big problems with this game, most of which are quality of life related:-You can't switch between zones without returning to the hub area first. And you can't just return to the village at will either, you have to get back to a camp first and talk to the scientist guy with his goofy hat first every single time. And when you need to go somewhere in the village for something, you can't just leave the second your business is complete, you have to walk or fast travel to the gate first. This started to get really annoying after the first few hours. It would be so much better if they let you jump between zones freely from the map.-The village is so slow to get around that it's usually faster to open the map and fast travel to the building across the street than it is to just walk there. All the areas where you don't have access to mounts feel annoyingly spacious in general-The pokebox (well, this game's equivalent) quickly becomes an eyesore. You have to talk to specific NPCs to access it, and there is no meaningful option to automatically sort or filter it. For this game in particular, this is a big problem. Between the ability to seamlessly throw pokeballs at wandering pokemon without encounters, the new pokedex research system and the new effort level system, you are encouraged to catch every pokemon you lay eyes on. But as for actually sorting through all those pokemon you catch, this game makes that process no less laborious than it would be in one of the 20 year old Pokemon games. That sucks. A lot.-There's no option to skip most cutscenes. The 'cinematic' moments you're free to skip, but the boring conversations you have 5 times each throughout the game you have to slowly click through each line of uninteresting dialogue.-No option to shorten or disable combat animations-The main boss fights for each zone are pretty lame. Not because the bosses themselves are uncool, but because the player's role in the fight is to chuck 100 bean bags at them.-The mounts vary in quality. They're more or less this game's answer to the Bicycle and traversal HMs from previous games. The deer is pretty great. The Surf mount is awesome and for sure a highlight of the game. The rest though are just lame. I expected the flying one to completely change how I interacted with the zones I'd been exploring up to that point; because it can fly, right? That should be awesome, like an aircraft in a GTA clone that you can pull out of your pocket. But no, it's just a glider pretty much. I mean gliders aren't so bad, but, cmon man. That was a massive letdown after how cool the fish was.",29-Jan-22,8,0.844827586,1,1,0
677,"Are graphics good? In terms of landscape, no they are about as basic as it gets nowadays, not necessarily bad just subpar and I have seen the lowered framerate that the PokÃ©mon get have when you get a certain distance from them.In terms of actual gameplay itself though, I really enjoyed it, the core loop of finding PokÃ©mon and doing different task in order to get more research point is enjoyable. You sort of just get lost in the exploring and finding PokÃ©mon only to find yourself at one of the corners of the area and you probably still missed a few things on the way.Despite the graphics this is a fun casual game to play, I could easily see someone playing this on a long train ride or car trip which is the sort of game you'd want on a portable system.",29-Jan-22,8,0.849056604,1,1,0
678,"This is, finally, a very solid entry in a franchise that has been stagnating for the last half a decade (being very generous). After SwSh, which was easily my least favorite Pkmn game of all time, and BDSP, which was, to me, an extremely pointless retread of an old game with very little in the way of anything new or compelling to offer, I was extremely skeptical and pretty convinced this game would end up being a mess. But, my curiosity ended up getting the better of me and I really have to say, I've been pretty thoroughly won over here. Ultimately it comes to the gameplay actually being quite compelling this time around, and it all comes down to the fact this game actually requires some thought on the part of the player. It's not terribly difficult/unforgiving or anything, but it isn't mindlessly easy either. You might actually need to think about type match ups, or what moves to teach your Pokemon, there might even be a bit of planning, resource management, and strategy at play here--in a Pokemon game! Imagine that, huh? Anyway I have no real massive complaints on the game itself, its quite fun, and not in the mindless, check a bunch of things off a list sort of way (even though there definitely is some that here). The only big shortcoming here is the visuals. I have never cared much about graphics, but I unfortunately have to say the game looks awful. Gamefreak needs more staff in their visual department and that's all there is to it. It isn't actively detrimental to the game in my opinion, but it's definitely going to both some people more than others, so be aware.",30-Jan-22,8,0.849056604,1,1,0

680,"I'm 10 hours in and look forward to this game. I was quite disappointed in my first few hours of the game (minus the opening dialogue, which gave me goosebumps). What i saw was an under baked game, with PokÃ©mon sprites fluctuating in quality (depending on where you were standing) & a complete Zelda BOTW rip off with less charm.However, once you get past the slow start & inconsistent graphics, the game starts to pick up. As your team gets stronger, you're able to do more & less likely to get destroyed in the wild. You can backtrack to see what you've missed previously.Once you get used to the mechanics & know how to navigate around it's actually pretty fun. There are plenty of side quests it's actually a bit annoying & overwhelming because you'll see 10 trillion people asking you to do things in the village.After **** on the game a bit, I do want to say there are some moments in the game that are really beautiful, e.g. the theme piano music starting as you're undetected in the grass & about to throw a pokeball at a Kadabra (lol). Also the combat is pretty good & quite visually appealing, although it's a bit derpy that you can run into the middle of the battle. Anyways, all things considered, the game has definitely grown on me & it can actually be a bit addictiveAnyways, after my quick review, I would say don't take my opinion for it, try it yourself & make your own mind up.",30-Jan-22,8,0.837209302,1,1,0

684,"Been playing PokÃ©mon since platinum and been through quite a bit of burn out from the last couple of games so how does legends hold up many will ask. Let?s get the big downside done first the lack of art direction I personally don?t mind lower graphics but this whole experience could of been more stylized like mhst2 or a game I picked up recently to play nino kuni which is a pretty old game it came out on the PlayStation 3 and is on switch but holds up because of it?s art direction. Second issue I?ve had is mostly the no abilities and held items on the PokÃ©mon help differentiate PokÃ©mon from each other in battle and because I like a few layers of complexity specially in turn based JRPGs.Now we?re past the bad first can I can say is this is the most fun I?ve ever had catching PokÃ©mon as the game allows you to engage them in a few different ways. Stealth is the first option and the method of my choice getting in the bonus from throwing the ball at their back is very satisfying, you can take the PokÃ©mon head on in battle if you want but most PokÃ©mon will run early game so for those who run start the battle back throwing your PokÃ©mon at them from behind fun the stun. Filling out the dex I thought was gonna be tedious but it?s fun as you gotta engage with a few different aspects of the the game you can catch them to level up your research level of said PokÃ©mon, give them berries, find ones of different weight/size, evolve, defeat them, battle with them to see them perform moves also yes it?ll count if you use them yourself in battle, and stealth catching them can also add to the research levels. Also exploring the open zones finding PokÃ©mon is great specially when you find a rare encounter you didn?t see the first time going through the area. Pro tip heavy balls early game are your friend but you gotta get close but it?s worth specially for catching alpha PokÃ©mon as they give a seed of mastery you can use to master a move back in town to use heavy or agile style with said move, great exp for the team, and a good chunk of money finally money which you?ll need to upgrading your inventory size.Onto the story and characters without any spoilers they are pretty good specially by PokÃ©mon standards. As usual PokÃ©mon has very visually striking characters and they have great personalities. Too bad there is no voice acting which feels like the next step for PokÃ©mon to go with their game as I have a tendency to speed read without voice acting and then kinda forget a little what is said after the fact but that?s me. But overall I think the story probably is the best I?ve seen out of PokÃ©mon black and white.In conclusion, I believe this game is great with all the ways you can engage with catching and filling your PokÃ©dex. The technical limitations show very heavily but the PokÃ©mon themselves are full of life and personality with how they are animated hopefully in the future these kind of games are allowed more time to bake in oven with a more solid art direction. Story and characters are great but still voice acting feels like it would do wonderfully in a series like this adding to the charming characters. Overall this game is an 8/10 if they continue with this formula for older audiences that?ll be a win",30-Jan-22,8,0.842105263,1,2,0
685,"Huge step foreward for pokemon. The semi-open world is a huge improvement for pokemon, but graphics could be better.

686,"The game is not perfect by far, for me mainly the graphics are the greatest point of disappointment. If only they would have taken a little longer to polish it out but alas. I can look over it however since I think the game is the best and funniest PokÃ©mon game since the Nintendo DS days. It's also the first game in a long time that I can truly play for hours on end, Day after day. Hatching a plan to sneak up to a strong PokÃ©mon you don't really want to fight but still catch and seeing that plan work out is the best thing ever. And even when you fail there is still something to learn from that failure to apply the next time. The AI and wild PokÃ©mon also feel stronger then other games, which for me is a huge plus. Makes you really think about what team you're gonna bring when going into the wild.TLTR : even though not perfect still a very fun game and super refreshing for the PokÃ©mon franchise.

687,"I do enjoy this game. Not as much as I would if it were a traditional pokemon game. My only gripe really is the opening; It felt like it took foreeeeeever to actually start my journey after having to shovel through dialogue and cutscenes, the tasks needed to advance. They just felt repetitive, and the world felt a bit empty. My entire time playing it, I was imagining what it would be like to do battle in a gym or wandering through kanto, hoenn, or johto regions with this new engine. I hope they think about doing such that for the next canon game.",30-Jan-22,8,0.837837838,1,1,0

690,"Overall it's a good game. I like the new ideas like catching Pokemon without having to enter combat or quickly switching between Pokemon during a battle.

691,"This is the game we?ve all been waiting for as day-one PokÃ©mon fans. Back in the days of Red and Blue, this is what we imagined the world of PokÃ©mon to be like. The open areas where you can joyously yeet pokeballs at all the mons in the overworld is oh so satisfying. To be able to have a linear path with the story, but still give you a lot of freedom in terms of how you want to build your team and gain experience with all of the research required to complete the first PokÃ©dex is a true blend of what fans have desired. While I think this game proves to be the strongest game in the franchise, gameplay-wise, I will say the artistic direction could?ve used a lot more talent. To see BOTW on switch as a launch title and look way more robust in terms of the environment than Legends, says to me that Gamefreak is in dire need of fresh eyes to lead them into their next core titles, as well as a beefed-up switch to enhance the overall experience. With that being said, the game is still looking to be a GOTY contender.",30-Jan-22,8,0.857142857,1,1,0

I love the pokedex mechanic and i think that is the real fun core of the game. However i also found some strange things that made me a little confused: As i've already said, the graphics are not THAT good, but this is not a big deal for me.There are too many useless praises to the main charachter that sometimes feel a little bit cringe.The game tends to be a little bit repetitive in some mechanics, like finish a boss then obtain a new level, then defeat another boss ect ect.",31-Jan-22,8,0.842105263,1,1,0
696,"This game is one of the most important entries that the PokÃ©mon company has ever done. Thankfully, this game delivers an experience that many PokÃ©mon fans have been waiting for years. However there are small flaws or annoyances that keep it from being the ultimate experience for a PokÃ©mon man.Let?s start out with some flaws. The game doesn?t look at its best even for Nintendo Switch standards. Everything seems to just be a lack of polish or detail. But that doesn?t mean that the graphics are always bad. Just to the point where it starts to get distracting and sticks out. The fixed camera when first entering a battle or talking to an npc can either clip through or be completely obstructed by an object. (Thankfully in PokÃ©mon battles you can move around the battlefield) One more thing is that through the three noble PokÃ©mon battles that I have completed, which serve as the boss battles of the game. They all feel like dodge and throw, with no real gameplay depth outside of it. You can send out PokÃ©mon when the noble PokÃ©mon is stunned, but you can completely ignore this message and keep on throwing balms and win without sending out a single PokÃ©mon. That?s it on the flaws, I might edit this review if I encounter more problems or good things about the game. Now for the good things. First of, this is a complete shift from the traditional PokÃ©mon formula. There is no gym battles, elite four, or any league to become champion of. Your job is to research PokÃ©mon and create the region?s first PokÃ©dex. I feel this gameplay can make or break some peoples interest to buy this game. But, I encourage PokÃ©mon fans to give this a try for themselves to see if this is the style of gameplay they enjoy to play. The gameplay is about catching and researching PokÃ©mon in which the objectives can vary between defeating the PokÃ©mon with certain moves, feeding it berries, seeing it use moves, or just straight up catching it. Alpha PokÃ©mon can also appear around the map and will always be tens of levels above your party. PokÃ©mon can also deal damage to you, the player causing you to faint and lose some items if you take too much damage. I love the animations of the PokÃ©mon, because they were able to focus on a smaller pool of PokÃ©mon and actually delivering on that promise. (Let?s not talk about SWSH) PokÃ©mon battles have also increased the freedom of the player. Now after a battle starts, you are freely able to move around the battlefield and look around with different viewing angles. A new mechanic is added with agile and strong styles of moves. Agile moves decrease the power of the move and give your PokÃ©mon more likely chance of getting their next move soon. Strong style is the opposite, increasing power and less likely chance of getting the next move sooner. This does give an extra layer of strategy and also scraps the idea of alternating moves. You can and will get two turns in succession or take two moves from an opponent in a row. Side quests can be lackluster but be a good thing to do when you don?t want to progress the story. Speaking of the story, I really can?t judge the story based on my opinions because of my style of gameplay. But when I can say is that there is more dialogue and a lot more cutscenes than a regular PokÃ©mon game. All in all, I support the gameplay direction that gamefreak is trying to do and hopefully this can be a regular occurring series and that some of the ideas will be implemented into gen 9 and beyond. I am a big PokÃ©mon fan and I hope that gamefreak will finally turn around the quality of games that have been released these last few years.",31-Jan-22,8,0.857142857,2,2,0
697,"Some reviews for this game baffle me. Decided to post my own because some of the reviews here make the game seem better/worse than it is, claim things that are straight up wrong and some of them aren't even reviews, but just rants against the fans/developers. Half of them also give me the feeling that the writer didn't even play the game.8/10 from me. The game actually shakes things up when compared to previous Pokemon games. The new gameplay formula is actually fresh and interesting.This game revolves mainly around building the first Pokedex of the location where the game takes place, the Hisui region. In previous games, filling up the Pokedex was done simply by catching a Pokemon, and the whole page for this Pokemon would be filled up immediatly. That is not the case here. Catching a Pokemon will only get you so far in this case, despite what some others claim here. To fill out the rest of a Pokemons Dex entry, you'll need to interact with this Pokemon in a variety of ways. Catching and battling are obvious, but there's more to it. Seeing it use certain moves, evolving it, finding different forms/genders, feeding it, and so on. All of this will get you closer towards a complete dex entry. Thankfully, you don't have to do every task to fill an entry.When compared to previous installments, the total number of Pokemon in this game is lower than usual. There are a total of 242 Pokemon in this game. Some may say this lazy on Game Freaks end, but I personally think that this is fine. Filling out the Pokedex would be a nightmare to do if there were a lot of Pokemon, which is a problem since that is the main focus here. Also, again despite what others may claim, there are plenty of new animations present for each Pokemon, so having a lower amount seems fair. Every Pokemon also has their own personality in the wild. This Pokedex and catching focused approach makes for a fun gameplay cycle.Speaking of the wild, this game isn't just your standard Pokemon RPG. There are 5 big, open maps for you to explore, each of which are unique. They are well designed, exploration is rewarded with collectibles, items and Pokemon, but not mandatory. Catching Pokemon is handled differently here too. You can do it the standard way by battling them and weakening them, but you also have the option to catch them outside of battle. You may want to take a different approach depending on the Pokemon you're after. Some are docile, some are hostile, and some are easily scared. You can choose to sneak up on a Pokemon using the environment around you, or lure them out with food. If you are being attacked, you have to dodge their attacks, initiate a battle, or throw objects at them to stun them. The new types of Pokeballs complement this system well.The battle system has also seen some changes, specifically the new attacking styles and turn system. The turn system was previously just done with the speed stat deciding who goes first, but now the speed stat is more important. A high speed can give your Pokemon multiple turns back-to-back, but this also applies to the opponent. The new attacking styles also impact this, as a strong style move makes you slower but more powerful, while an agile style move does the opposite. Both styles also take more PP than a normal move. You can also walk around during these battles, but this doesn't have much of an impact on anything. Some battles will even have you outnumbered against multiple Pokemon at once.Due to the setting/story of the game, trainers aren't very common, but they are present. Gyms/Leaders aren't here, and have been replaced by the Noble Pokemon. These are essentially the bosses of the game, and have you battling them unlike any regular Pokemon.I'm sure you've seen this plenty of times, but graphically, the game is sub-par. The main issue seems to be muddy and low-res textures, bland lighting (lack of shadows and reflections) and some performance related issues (render distance of objects and the framerate of NPC's/Pokemon). Graphics don't mean everything but in this case it's all very noticable and should've been better. The game runs fine at 30 FPS overall, with a few stutters here and there. Music/Sound design however is some good stuff, but this has always been a stronger point for this series.I'm no expert on stories but what's here is fine. It's pretty interesting, mainly due to the setting. First two or so hours are pretty dialogue heavy due to tutorials and whatnot and could've been a bit less.Quality of life improvements are definitely present. The best change here is probably a better gameplay flow thanks to the better menu design, and less menu's in general.Overal, a big step and a fresh take on Pokemon. A new approach to gameplay and a fun cycle keeps me invested, with quality of life improvements everywhere. Graphically sub-par, bur story and sound design are fine. Interested to see where Pokemon goes after this. I'd say it's worth full price.",31-Jan-22,8,0.857142857,1,1,0
698,"Regardless of my initial skepticism, I believe this is a really nice / fun game. I wasn't really sure I would enjoy this entry since I have always been more focused on pokemon battles with gyms and the pokemon league, rather than completing the pokedex. This game is solely related to completing the first pokedex. There aren't many trainer battles, which are made up for by introducing new challenges: for example alpha pokemon.I think they nailed the gameplay loop quite well, Arceus introduces an open world game where collecting and training pokemon is a lot of fun and engaging. I haven't enjoyed the latest main line games that much (Sword and Shield / Diamon and Pearl remake) and Arceus really feels like a much needed breath of fresh air for the series.This is not the best pokemon game ever made, nor is it going to satisfy everyone. If you are interested in a new take on the Pokemon series, where you can freely explore a world full of pokemon in an engaging setting: then this game could be right up your ally.",01-Feb-22,8,0.875,1,1,0

All the characters are unique in their own little ways, move animations are beautiful and I love the new battle system.

I wish the world was more open like BOTW with less hand-holding, but compared to other pokemon games that feel like they're on rails this is a breath of fresh air.",01-Feb-22,8,0.833333333,2,4,9.5

702,The graphics are just bad. But that's the only big point. The gameplay feels great and i think this is a really good step for the next Pokemon games. The best Pokemon game i played on Switch.

703,"This game has a lot of what I've wanted from a PokÃ©mon game. It's really good. It's like the devs came together and said ""We're tired of the complaints. Let's make a better PokÃ©mon game."" It got lots of good stuff: a cool story, a fine collection of PokÃ©mon, interesting characters, some mysteries to solve, excellent music, overdue quality of life changes, refined (and addictive) catching and battling mechanics, an interesting and sometimes beautiful world to explore... It's simply closer to the PokÃ©mon game fans have wanted for decades. The graphics are mostly ok and can look good, and they certainly don't take anything away from the experience. They're just rough and there is pop-in and low-res textures. Most importantly though: it's a lot of fun.The game clearly took some inspiration from Zelda: Breath of the Wild. But it simply lacks things that BotW got. And those are things it would need for a rating anywhere close to BotW. Things like better textures, voice acting, more modern graphics, larger/more detailed areas, more ruins and generally more to explore, more settlements and camps, Pokemon should be doing more than just walking around aimlessly and sleeping, dynamic weather affecting gameplay, better quests and side quests etc. The game is still too much fun for a 7/10 imo.",05-Feb-22,8,0.75,1,1,0
704,"The game play is amazing, it's finally a redesign of the original formula. The boss battles are great fun, my only complaint is the graphics are really weak.

705,"I'm 30 hours in and it's amazing.The first 2 hours were a pain in the ass and I feel like they guide the player so much, it's infuriating. I'd prefer it if the game let you learn a lot more by yourself. The mechanics aren't complicated at all so there's no need to explain everything like it's the first time I'm playing a video game in my life.The combat system is fluid and you can enter a fight beat a pokemon and then start doing something else right after. The only compaint would be that it's lacking a bit. You can't summon more than one pokemon at the time, but you can fight against four. If there was a way to summon more pokemon at the time or if the attacks could hit multiple targets it would be better. Something interesting is the fact that you don't have to fight a pokemon every 5 seconds. If you prefer to, you can almost play the entier game by just catching pokemons and gathering ressources.I'd really like to have a sequel with better graphics and polished mechanics. That's pretty much all it needs to be rated 10/10",02-Feb-22,8,0.6,1,1,0
706,"I?ll start with the bad. While the gameplay has evolved, the methods of story delivery have not changed a bit since the days of the DS - lots of reading and one big climactic fully rendered cut scene. In this fully expansive 3D world, 85% of the story is still dull cutscenes with text box after text box and no voice acting. While this isn?t inherently bad, nothing interesting is provided to keep your attention. The animation and rigging is downright lazy at times and the human character expressions / movement are uncanny despite their brilliant designs. Every time you interact with a human, it shatters the immersion as they play back the same 3 basic movements. The story itself is decent but is hidden behind layers of ?telling instead of showing?? ie black screens and sounds to imply something is happening. I find myself just pressing the B button in rapid succession to get back to the actual fun parts. The graphics are the next gripe. It genuinely looks like a Wii game or older and it doesn?t seem that Gamefreak developers had the time to truly optimize this game for the system it?s on. My girlfriend who doesn?t play video games at all commented that it ?looks like an old game??the first time she saw me play it. Optimizing takes time, so it seems they just dialed down the graphics to focus on other more important things. While the game looks great sometimes and the 3D models are beautifully designed, the graphics cannot be overlooked. Ugly textures, objects randomly clipping through each other, character details like hair are flat and lifeless, hovering 6 inches above the ground in some areas, you get it. Now, here?s where the game get literally everything else right. My first PokÃ©mon game was PokÃ©mon Diamond, and this is the most fun I?ve had playing a PokÃ©mon game since then. The core gameplay is downright addicting, as the act of sneaking up on PokÃ©mon, learning their behavior, stunning them with items, choosing when to battle is just??chefs kiss. It really feels like you?re in the world of PokÃ©mon, running around just catching the little guys like you always wanted to as a kid. The wild battles are high stakes a lot of the time, as it only takes one alpha PokÃ©mon to knock out your whole team. I found myself feeling genuine terror the first time I saw that alpha Rapidash, something that is MORE than welcome in a PokÃ©mon game. In this regard, it?s everything you could want until that pesky story gets in the way. It?s easy to spend hours upon hours just filling out research tasks. It?s a huge JUMP in the right direction for PokÃ©mon, as the old battle mechanics ran their course over a decade ago.It?s also exceedingly clear that this game is Gamefreak?s love letter to sinnoh, from the music, placement of landmarks and overall design of the wild areas. It?s really fun to feel like you?re exploring the past version of the region you explored as a kid. The moment you realize you?re in Eterna Forest or one of the legendary lakes, with the music to boot, is second to none. You won?t enjoy this game nearly as much if you don?t have the nostalgic ties to Sinnoh. Overall, while this game definitely drops the ball in a lot of areas, it picks it up and runs with it in so many others. I?ve had hours upon hours of genuinely bewildering experiences playing this game, just by running around and catching PokÃ©mon the way The Lor-Arceus intended. The gameplay is second to none, and it?s a shame that Gamefreak didn?t get the proper time to see this game all of the way through.",02-Feb-22,8,0.6,1,1,0

723,"The most fun PokÃ©mon game I played in years!! The new gameplay of mix of stealth and combat is very polished. Progression in game is lock behind what your star rank is so it's given you motivation to catch and do Pokedex research in the game. Pokedex research is simple and easy to do come done to how many PokÃ©mon you catch to how many you have beaten in battle or what type of moves you us to beat a PokÃ©mon. The biggest complaint I have is the Game Engine they used (think it the same one Game Freak used for Sword and Sheild) with textures pop in slow and the pop in before PokÃ©mon do which can get annoying. Texture with glitch out in battles and wild PokÃ©mon will randomly clip thought rock and tress making them uncatchable, and graphic aren't good at all but its Game Freak they never work on that.",24-Feb-22,8,0,2,2,0
724,"A great step forward for the pokemon series, however, needs work. Honestly the most fun ive had catching pokemon and running through the world. This game has revamped the combat system as well as the pokedex. i would recommend this to anyone who has played pokemon and people who have been wanting something more from the franchise. The reason i gave this game an 8 is even though the world is fun to run around in and the combat is interesting, the game does look pretty bland mostly due to graphics. This is surely a great step forward for the franchise but there is a lot of room to improve!",23-Feb-22,8,0,2,2,0
725,This game is a promising evolution for the Pokemon series and I hope the direction the series will go in.

Gameplay is really good though, i would say that if you are able to look pass the story, lack of multiplayer battle system, gym battles and the horrendously bland and lifeless world of Hisui this is an alright game to pick up but with a company as big as Game Freak it feels kinda lazy and they should be doing more",29-Jan-22,7,0.113636364,6,24,7.9
727,"Completed in 20hours, was extremely boring story, no gyms or leagues. Easily exploited gameplay that allowed me to catch everything with a single ball and no aggro. Graphic so old it looks like ps2 era. No idea why people rate this higher than sword and sheild when it's half baked game. Add ability to throw a ball which is in pokemon go so it's nothing new.",02-Feb-22,7,0.4,30,33,7.2
728,"Legends Arceus, as just a game without its franchise, would definitely be mediocre. It is a collect-a-thon with some QoL elements, a serviceable plot, subpar graphics, and a musical score which, while charming , is a bit too subtle in the overworld. The fact that it has a full game price tag would definitely turn some people away.With that said, as a PokÃ©mon game, it is pretty damn good! Not GREAT but GOOD. The game's new focus on it's old ""catch em' all"" motto has turned out to be for the better. Why? The best way to describe why is to address how this game deals with the complaints previous entries have received:Same Old Gyms and Championship? No and no. Your exploration of the world and your capturing of PokÃ©mon now serve as the goal posts for your progress.Trade Evolutions? Gone with an in-game item.Animations? While the models and art style of the world are worse, they are more expressive than I remember them being in both BDSP and SWSH.Too Many Cutscenes/Dialogue Boxes? Plot is to the point: catch em' all and do quests to advance! You will not be kept from the game for too long at any point.Level Capture Block? Gone! Not to worry though, catching a strong PokÃ©mon is not going to suddenly break the game for you. The one thing that is still restricted are the level limits of your PokÃ©mon obeying you. Catch one out of your league and it will not listen to you.Too Much Experience? While you do still have EXP Share, it's distributed better and more sparingly. If I can catch a Level 40 Rapidash in the starting area due to a fluke and only get a few levels, I'd say it's pretty balanced.Grinding sucks? The focus is on catching and that is where most of your EXP is going to come from. Just sneak and throw, no long battles necessary (except in certain cases). You can battle but...Battles suck? This game gave one hell of a boost to your opponents. They can abuse the special mechanics you can use and the strength in level differences is not as pronounced now. You have to play smart since the combat isn't just single turn switches anymore.Listen, if you wanted a PokÃ©mon game that would erase all of the past controversial entries, this is not that game. It is very fun but, as many people rightfully think, this could have been done sooner and better. Still, I can't help but really enjoy this game. Maybe it's just a one-time thing but I sincerely hope that the fun I am having now is a sign that Gamefreak is going in the right direction with its game development.",29-Jan-22,7,0.259259259,1,2,0

They took a risk although not far enough, but it is the best PokÃ©mon game in years. Now they need to push further. Make it truly open world. Create better AI for roaming PokÃ©mon, interactions with environment, better animations. Add gyms back in the next one, allow us to ride your own PokÃ©mon on ground, air, and sea. Add more towns and cities to explore. More caves and dungeons, add more raids. And add a multiplayer aspect. Maybe something akin to Destiny. Where 30-50 players share the open world with you at any given time. Again, step in the right direction. Can?t wait for the dlc and future releases with this formula. Excited for the future.",31-Jan-22,7,0.75,9,14,8

732,"I'm nearly 20 hours in when I'm writing this review, my first impression for this game is that it's probably the most unique pokemon game by far. The fact that GameFreak decided to try something new in a Pokemon game without reusing the previous pokemon formula really impressed me. Overall the game wasn't really mind blowing but it did laid the groundwork for future pokemon games.There are some other stuff to be work on such as the visual and graphic. Voice acting in Pokemon is always somthing I wanted in the game and it's kinda disappointing that they continue to overlook that aspect. Although I love the new game mechanics of catching pokemon that was implemented, I felt that the map in this game is really empty and lifeless at times. The missions in the game could be tedious at time when they force you to catch ""X"" pokemon in a ""X"" amount to progress.All things consider, it's a good Pokemon game that could have been better and I hope that GameFreak will continue to improve their future Pokemon games as they are going down the right path with Pokemon Legends Arceus.",01-Feb-22,7,0.363636364,23,32,7.7
733,This game had the potential to be a masterpiece. Unfortunately the lack of voice acting and polished/improved graphics prevent it. That being said this is still a good game and worth the adventure for pokemon fans. It has me so excited for the future of what pikemon games have in store. I truly hope they will give one pokemon game the time and love it deserves to make a game as good as super mario odyssey and breath of the wild. This is the closest we have gotten to it. But there is still a long way to go.,01-Feb-22,7,0.428571429,4,17,9
734,"It's good, feels fresh. New catching system is great. It just feels kinda rushed thou and like it wants you to mainly be re-catching the same PokÃ©mon all the time to fill out that PokÃ©dex. And there is even less emphasis placed on story and battles. I don't like how there is almost no trainers battles, as having high level good PokÃ©mon being pointless.",02-Feb-22,7,0.6,6,9,5
735,"The new style of gameplay is fresh and exciting, however I feel disappointed by the lack of PVP, pokemon abilities, and held items. The open world aspect is fun and questing feels more like a modern RPG than pokemon. While the graphics of NPCs and the game in general are laughable, the gameplay is smooth when throwing pokeballs and using a mount to transverse the open world.",04-Feb-22,7,0.4,1,1,0
736,"You may want to stick this review out. It's a rollercoaster ride.There are two driving forces in this game. One force that takes the game in either direction. In the direction of being a good game, there is the amount of fan service in the game. New forms of PokÃ©mon, an regional origin story, new strategies to collect PokÃ©mon, Breath of the Wild menus, sounds, and gameplay. The negative driving force however is how long it takes for the player to be able to enjoy these things.It isn't as if the player is always learning new things that they must use in the gameplay. The opposite actually. Almost everything needed to complete the game is handed to you right off the bat. This is not an inherently bad feature. This kind of freedom allows each player to create individual experiences and choose their own way to complete each task. Sadly, in this game, there are no choices to be made. It's simply a game where you build your collection, with new environments only serving as a change of scenery. Even then, the same forest area is used for a majority of three out of five areas. Finally, the graphics are unacceptable. This is something that can be looked over when we talk about quality, since gameplay is most important, but it's a sad thought when you realize every once in a while how poor the graphics are.With all of the complaints somehow, someway, this game made me return to my desk and continue where I left off the night before. Why was I coming back? What kind of game do I turn on and start complaining about? Freedom. For once, you aren't just a PokÃ©mon Trainer. You're a collector. A researcher. The one that others look up to. You are the obstacle in their way from the very start. For PokÃ©mon fans this story is one they've wanted to know for so long, and want even more of in the future. It's PokÃ©mon history being played out and created by you. The most important thing in the entire game is collecting and studying things about PokÃ©mon that have never been such a large focus.Effort. That's what this game has. It's not the norm for the developers. It's unexplored territory. They made their mistakes, the game has it's flaws, but it has the soul that a good PokÃ©mon game should have. They didn't leave out crucial features to make the game more marketable to wider audiences. They didn't make the story simple so everybody could follow it. It's a huge chapter in the PokÃ©mon world and one that's worth experiencing, even through the flaws in it's core. As fans we all have our opinions about this game, but this game will absolutely be built on in the future, and is a foundation for the future of fun in the PokÃ©mon franchise.",01-Feb-22,7,0.428571429,29,29,7.8
737,A good improvement on the Pokemon formula. The gameplay loop is awesome if you're a completionist like me. The things that are being the score down is this game is either unoptimized on the switch or the switch is not powerful enough for the game. I think a mixture of both are true. There is a lot of pop in and I have seen other games that shouldn't be able to run on the switch be able to run quite well so this is disappointing. The other thing is the small Dex size. 240 Pokemon for a franchise that is right around 100 is too small to reasonably charge 60 bucks.,30-Jan-22,7,0.12195122,5,6,9.3
738,"At first sight, Pokemon Legends: Arceus seems to be the game fans have been pleading about for all these years: an open world game where you can freely explore the lands and fight Pokemon. In a way, that is true, but the execution was very flawed. The game is restricted to zones, otherwise known as an ""open-zone"" game. This was a disappointment, especially when the earlier trailers made it out to be a game similar to BOTW. Not only that, but the game restricts you from entering certain areas of zones if you haven't filled out enough of the Pokedex. However, this shouldn't be too much of an issue, as long as you are doing more than just following the missions.The main gameplay loop is very fun. Being able to explore freely(in the zones of course) and catch, fight, or run away from Pokemon doesn't get old... well at least for most of the game. It starts to tedious after a while, especially because it's REQUIRED to access certain areas.The Pokemon don't do anything interesting; they are completely lifeless. They either walk around, sleep, or occasionally teleport depending on the Pokemon. Why not have some Pokemon fight with each other occasionally, or have two Pikachu's touching their tails as a greeting(which is quite literally in their Pokedex entry), stuff like that which would make the world feel more active. The zones themselves are bare-boned, with only the most basic terrain. Not to mention, the graphics are awful for a 2022 Nintendo Switch game. The terrain looks worse than games on the GameCube.When you aren't following the main story or exploring the world for fun, you're probably doing Requests, otherwise known as sidequests. These sidequests are the most basic, boring, and tedious tasks you can think of. They're all the same; catch a specific Pokemon, fill out a specific Pokemon's Pokedex entry, or collect a certain amount of an item to bring back to the requester. It felt like doing homework going through these. However, there are a couple of fun ones. One of them, you get to catch a shiny Ponyta. But like I said, there are only a COUPLE of these. It feels like the developers were asked to make a sidequest system last minute, so they had to rush like 100 of them and made them all practically the same thing.There IS a story, but it's pretty awful. Every cutscene is just two or more characters staring at eachother with 0 sound effects or voice acting, and these cutscenes happen ALL. THE. F****ING. TIME. The tutorial of the game is like an hour long and you are CONSTANTLY being interrupted whenever you get a chance to actually do something. These interruptions are not as frequent as the tutorial throughout the rest of the game, but that isn't saying much.TL;DR: Pokemon Legends: Arceus has a great concept, but it's incredibly obvious Game Freak half-assed many things. It's not truly open-world, and the restrictions placed upon you really take away a lot of the fun you could have. However, despite all of this, the gameplay loop is still incredibly addicting and fun to the point where this game deserves a 7. I hope we get more games like this in the future in which all the issues are ironed out, because this game really had potential.",06-Feb-22,7,0.6,2,2,0
739,"The game is very fun and addictive but the graphics are terrible and the gameplay feels like a Pokemon GO with open area elements like Monster Hunter. It's surely an enjoyable game if you're a Pokemon fan but we deserve better and Game Freak needs to take their time and make a fantastic game that can be forever remembered, not just rush game development and put low effort so they can make money from games every year.",30-Jan-22,7,0.071428571,4,32,9.7
740,"Pkmn Legends Arceus (PLA) is a step in the right direction but still shows how Gamefreak (GF) makes minuscule progress in game design. Let me start out with the good. I haven't had FUN playing a Pkmn game in so many years, and finally, a game delivers on the fun. I haven't felt a pkmn game had hope to be considered a good game until now. That being said, I am baffled at why GF made this game worse than it needed to be. Fans have been complaining at how long tutorials are and this game's tutorial is a PAIN to play. And yet, for all the new features in the game, the tutorial teaches you none of them really (its essentially just capture a pkmn tutorial). To me that's sort of the story of this game. Fun to play but the game refuses to let you enjoy it. There are SO MANY cutscenes in this game that take you out of the experience. Why you still can't skip them is beyond me. Why I still have to wait for each text scroll before I can continue to the next one makes no sense to me. Honestly, if this game had a skippable tutorial and skippable cutscenes or just none at all - it would be a much more pleasant experience. The sad part about that complaint is that GF has no excuse. Yes the graphics are awful but there's a million excuses I can give for that (no engine, Switch can't handle it, time constraints vs risk of project success, etc.). But the tutorials and cutscene pacing was a conscious choice by GF that could've been avoided. I'm glad this game exists and I'm hoping GF can merge all these changes into a new mainline series of games. As of right now, PLA is a step in the right direction for GF, but unfortunately a super safe dive at change and a continued display of antiquated game design. I would love for GF to continue along this path and not give up but this game is not quite there. Giant leap for a pkmn game but I am tired of giving Pkmn a pass just bc I love the franchise so much.",22-Feb-22,7,1,3,3,0
741,"I like the exploration Mechanic's, but sometimes the game feels too repetitive. The missions would be more epic, I keep farming and exploring all the time. The alpha battles breaks this a little, but I miss the epic battles at gyms.",30-Jan-22,7,0.15625,1,1,0
742,"Definitely a weird Pokemon game.The bad:The graphics are bad and they only get worseThe story is not very good and the lack of voice acting, considering the graphics, doesn't do the game any favoursThe game wants you to complete the Pokedex but a couple of really BS long term collectathon puzzles that artificially pad out timeMost of the best parts of the game are locked to after the credits or even 50 hours in.The story is gated by Pokedex progressionThe good:Exploring areas and finding new Pokemon is funThe game has made filling the Pokedex a significantly more active taskThe new battle system is better and creates closer and more strategic battlesThe final act of the story is enjoyableThe soundtrack has some genuine bangersPokemon Legends Arceus asks you to complete the Pokedex fully to unlock the whole game to be able to then turn around and appreciate the value of what you played, but a big if here is ""How many people are really going to do that?"" at least 80% of players are not going to reach the very end and are as a result going to leave this game having experienced a mediocre story with an enjoyable final act. Some players will reach the end of the post-game story quest which genuinely has an awesome conclusion and is honestly challenging, but very few are going to reach the very end.This game is rich with little optimisations to the Pokemon formula. The rocks and trees that you throw your Pokemon at to gather resources for crafting are a great system. The ride pokemon that allow you to travel faster, over water, and through the air or up mountains, is a great system. The addition of Strong and Agile Style and the Move Order really make long battles way, way better. Once you get a grasp of how to work the system it is excellent. The cheeky moves you can do and your opponents will also do make battles significantly more even fights than ever before. It is unfortunate that very few trainers in the game have large parties of Pokemon that allow the system to shine. Crafting is great, for the most part wild Pokemon behaviour is great. The Pokedex challenges that change from Pokemon to Pokemon keep the game fresh. The boss fights are a good idea that has a lot of potential, but some of them didn't land this time around.This game is brought down so much by its graphics and GameFreak's pulled punches. The game is simply ugly. The ugliness of this game never relents and is at all times making the experience worse than it could be. Textures are constantly being reused, Pokemon load distance can be fine but it can also be abysmal, with Pokemon loading only if you're a few metres away if you're flying over. It feels like GameFreak hasn't tried, and that this game is more so a pitch to the playerbase, asking ""How does this new gameplay loop feel?""To me, this game has landed well because I've always enjoyed the catching pursuit of the game. I want to see where this game takes us. Gamefreak has done some excellent things with this game and from here it's a matter of trimming the fat like the artificial time-sinks or the story progression gates, and refining what else has potential here. Battles go largely unsung and that is a shame, Pokemon feel more alive than ever in their environments, boss fights are pretty cool, the story was one of the best Pokemon stories and it really wasn't good for the most part. Improve and add more of these parts of the game that have potential and eventually we'll have a great game.",31-Jan-22,7,0.2,2,2,0
743,"I love this game, I think it is one of the best, if not the absolute best, PokÃ©mon games that has ever been made. I also think it will be a contender for GOTY which will be a true achievement for this game and the series. I am scoring it as I have because they seemed to stop working on the game at a point and just accepted it where it was.On the Narrative: This game has a story which loosely makes sense. it's interesting, it captures the imagination of everyone from the newest trainer to the most hardened veteran. but there are parts where it just doesn't seem to go far enough. Each boss fight feels repetitive with no ""real"" mechanical changes present in them other than the monster you are fighting. There are parts of the game where the narrative does genuinely tug at the heartstrings and make me as the player feel that I am an in a real world with people in it that I should care about. But also after the initial scene of you waking up on a beach in a completely different time/era. There is basically no mention of trying to get home. I understand that the point of the game is in-fact to catch PokÃ©mon. But even if at some point during the collection of the research something was mentioned along ""the more we learn the closer we are to figuring out how we might be able to get you home"" would be more dynamic. It all feels a little lazy and like they couldn't find a way to start the story so they just through in you coming back in time.On Gameplay: really the gameplay is incredible for a PokÃ©mon game I don't feel like I'm just making these incredible creatures fight for no reason. Instead I can just catch PokÃ©mon in the guise of research and then release them as a regular part of the game. it is a truly amazing step for the series. every throw of a pokeball feels great, and each time I craft something en masse I get a little shot of serotonin knowing that I made my own pokeballs. However for some reason that is never explained narratively or visually I appear completely unable to climb even the simplest hill. nor can I swim for some reason. the reason for these hinderances as a player are obvious, they don't want me to access the areas early when the PokÃ©mon are stronger. but at least make it visually or narratively interesting. Can't make it up that hill? it's because it's too steep and you don't have climbing gear, or maybe it is raining so it's simply to slippery to climb. You can't swim because PokÃ©mon will attack you, or maybe because you as a character don't know how to swim. at least give me a reason for these road blocks in a game which proudly calls itself ""open world""Final thoughts: THis game is a tremendous step forward for Pokemon as a series. it adds a new breath into something which hasn't truly experienced new-ness in what feels like over two decades. I hope that they take this side series to a new area in the future as well, whether that means an ancient Hoenn region, or perhaps ancient Alola. ANYWHERE BUT KANTO. I also hope that whatever the next ""main series"" game is it borrows from at least the innovation in the gameplay so that PokÃ©mon are seen less as competitive tools, and more like the subjects of research that the game proports them to be.",04-Feb-22,7,0.4,5,7,8.1
744,"Pokemon Legends: Arceus is a bold new step by Nintendo and Gamefreak that would have been outstanding several years ago. PLA does a great job of making you feel like you truly exist in the Pokemon world and does a good job immersing the player through all of the new mechanics it presents.Catching new Pokemon is more dynamic than it has ever been before. You can choose the old route: start a battle, weaken the enemy, then attempt to catch them, or you can utilize the open world and items you have at your disposal to distract, feed, or even stun them and simply throw the ball. It is even possible to use this method to catch ""Alpha"" pokemon unaware and capture them without need of a battle.There is an all new crafting system as well. While it is quite simplistic it does get the job done. I found myself going out into the wild simply to gather materials for crafting. Action to reward. Basic. Good job. The game also goes a solid job offering newer, more powerful items as you progress to make it seem like you're actually improving as a member of the survey corps.Story wise, it's what you'd expect from a Pokemon game. Solid enough, keeps your attention for the most part, but nothing remarkable. There's no ""wow"" moment in the story nor are there any moments that elicit much of an emotional response. Towards the end I was skipping dialogue because I just wanted to ""play the game"".The battles themselves are largely the same. The ability to run around was interesting for the first couple of battles but after that I forgot you even could and stopped doing it altogether. There's no real reason to move around outside of seeing different angles. Pokemon don't randomly target the player character in battle and as long as you don't stand directly between the Pokemon fighting you're safe from harm. Some status conditions did get updated which felt long overdue.Now, the bad...The game looks terrible. The game runs terribly. Unacceptably awful for a full fledged console game in 2022. Jagged edges, frame pacing, models popping in and out of existence, and several graphical glitches plague the game and severely hurt the score. It is either time for Gamefreak to find a new game engine or for Nintendo to find a new developer. This does not cut it. To be clear, I like the art style they tried for. It could have been a very aesthetically pleasing appearance but it just isn't. It is ugly and is very poorly optimized. The retail price of $60 does not reflect the amount of polish put into this game. Very disappointing presentation for Pokemon on the Switch. Again.All in all, I greatly enjoyed my experience and will likely playthrough the game several times. I know in this world of hyperbole and dramatics a 7 seems like a low score. It's not.

752,"Pokemon has generally been going in the right direction; Let's Go and Sword/Shield brought in the 3D aspect that Game Freak denied avid players for years. The system in Pokemon Legends: Arceus in terms of battle and capture is unquestionably superior to every Pokemon game preceding it. The death of the battle screen is satisfying to say for the least. The in-world interaction is a great addition. My issue is, the better looking battles are few and far between. There are not many Pokemon trainers in this game nor are there gyms. If the storyline had induced the building of towns & settlements upon completion that led to more trainers and the first ever gyms the game would have been 1000% more effective. While this game certainly succeeded in putting old and tired mechanics to rest, it failed by foregoing the aspect of competition.My hope is that Arceus will remedy this by way of DLC, and hopefully much more expansive DLC than those we saw in sword/shield.

I found myself just getting through the story without caring much about anything or anyone. Catching Pokemon in different and unique ways is fantastic. Strong and Agile style feel like they need more time in the oven. Performance is unacceptable for a game that looks this poor. The game feels as if it needed more time to reach excellence. I am happy that everyone is enjoying their time on the game though, however I feel it is disingenuous to give this game a 10/10 with glaring issues such as these.",03-Feb-22,7,0.5,1,1,0
760,"The standards for Pokemon games is at an all time low. While Legends Arceus is by no means bad, it continues the trend of a barebones game that feels immediately outdated in a franchise that just doesn't seem to grow. It's a backwards step, maybe a reduction of the formula to set a new foundation for later games, but it's just a bit too late for me. The world isn't an enjoyment to traverse. It's hindered by being visually underwhelming, but it just lacks a sense of activity. The pokemon exist only for the player. They don't interact with the world in any meaningful way, they're just collectibles. In the past, this wasn't as big of a problem because creating a team to conquer the league was always your goal; here, the pokemon are the only real goal. Yet, they just linger as mostly aggressive or timid creatures not really displaying much if their nature or showing character. Maybe you're now thinking I expect too much, and yes, I do. I expect a lot from one of the most successful franchises of my lifetime. Considering other titles in the franchise have had features that would be suitable here, but as is the trend with Pokemon games; we lose 3 features and gain 1. And yet, here we are, with one of the most well received games in the franchise in a while. If only, it seems, because the game is just about good enough. Is it a step in the right direction? Absolutely. Is it a good pokemon game? Sure. In a vacuum of just pokemon games it may be one of the best. But I'm of the opinion it should be better. Call it entitled, but having supported the franchise since the first iteration, I do think the fanbase deserves a game of much higher quality. Which now leaves us in the position we're all in; we want to support the good parts of the franchise in hopes we get better versions of that. But the excitement and initial highly positive reaction from just getting something that isn't a disappointment means the quality of this game (which is quite low) is more than enough for a company that just wants to make more money. It's an okay game. It's not bad, but it's not great. And when the honeymoon period wears off, we'll be back to a state of disappointment as we wait for something truly good.",06-Feb-22,7,0.5,1,2,0
761,"I've completed the 100% of the game last night. I'll always recommend this game to the franchise's fans but not without many criticisms.This game changes the game play completely with many long awaited new mechanics that we can only hope will stay in the future games. It's still a major improvement from the past games especially the recent BDSP remakes.Unfortunately the technical aspects of this title are lacking and may lower the enjoyment of this experience by a lot.It's sad to know that your avatar is exploring a forest just because of its name appearing on the top corner and not by the visual environment. It's unsatisfying having many places very similar to one another inside the same map. The art direction is great as always but the immersion is ruined by its lacking.We knew of this lacking by the trailer but I would have still granted an 8 out of this game if not for another very disturbing aspect. The writing in this game is a new low. PokÃ©mon had always had childish writing but in this instance every other dialog contradicts the one before. We are in a time where pokÃ©mon are feared but 50% of the village population is from a well established region where they already have pokÃ©ride, HM and are living peacefully with the pokÃ©mon. We are told that no one knows how to capture pokÃ©mon then they explain to us how to do so. They told us we are the greater battler but we have a teacher for that way more skilled than us. We are told that all the pokÃ©mon are fearsome then we are shown other character knowing that there are many species that are very peaceful toward them and easy to catch or to live with.I know this game is mostly for children but I would love to have a game not contradicting itself so often.The combat mechanics are an improvement but they need some fixing especially while battling other trainers. If you build, like me, a slow team it might occur that when one member is KO the next one entering will have to wait 2/3 moves from the opponent resulting in another KO without being able to do anything. In late game I had to rethink my team because one trainer attacked 13 times in a row demolishing my team. This is not a rise in the difficulty but some design flaw since I might want to play with my favorite pokÃ©mon without having such a disadvantage and all slower pokÃ©mon fill penalized.Over all the game is a good one and the game play loop in enjoyable. If they keep working on their optimizations skills and fix up the few problem this game could be a new starting point for the brand,",07-Feb-22,7,0.6,1,1,0

765,"Tras unas 40 horas jugadas en Leyendas Arceus, me veo en la obligaciÃ³n de comentar lo positivo y negativo de este nuevo tÃ­tulo en la franquicia, una en la que llevo metido desde su primer juego harÃ¡ ya mÃ¡s de 20 aÃ±os. Leyendas Arceus ofrece una nueva forma de explorar y capturar a los PokÃ©mon, renovando la forma en la que realizamos los combates y un poco acercÃ¡ndonos a la fÃ³rmula de mundo abierto, aunque con ciertas limitaciones. Si bien las primeras 15 horas las disfrutÃ© bastante, pronto me di cuenta de lo repetitivo que acababa siendo llegar a un nuevo lugar y que tras un par de horas explorando a fondo, sentÃ­a que muchos espacios estaban desaprovechados, y que podrÃ­an haberse aprovechado para meter mÃ¡s puntos de interÃ©s o que tuvieran alguna sorpresa inesperada. En la base, siento que es un juego que de aquÃ­ a un par de entregas va a ofrecer un resultado muy firme y sÃ³lido y que gradualmente se acercarÃ¡ mÃ¡s al gran juego soÃ±ado por muchos de la franquicia. Si mi nota no es la mÃ¡s alta no es porque no me guste, sino porque sÃ© que a la larga, usando esta base obtendremos juegos cada vez mejores y mÃ¡s interesantes, con mÃ¡s variedad de situaciones, entornos, con una mayor inmersiÃ³n, mÃ¡s actual a nivel artÃ­stico. PokÃ©mon Leyendas Arceus es un juego muy entretenido, refrescante, y que sienta una base para juegos mucho mejores. AdemÃ¡s, la narrativa ha sido mÃ¡s interesante que en otras entregas, y espero que siga asÃ­.Cosas que me gustarÃ­a que volvieran o estuvieran en el futuro:- MÃ¡s combates contra entrenadores. Por la temÃ¡tica, es lÃ³gico que en Arceus no hayan muchos, pero espero muchos combates contra otros entrenadores en futuras entregas, como en los juegos anteriores. La dificultad la han llevado bien en Arceus, y me molarÃ­a verlo reflejado en combates contra lÃ­deres de gimnasio y una liga PokÃ©mon.- Modo PVP. El competitivo me es indiferente, pero molarÃ­a que hubiera una forma para combatir contra otros jugadores.- MÃ¡s PokÃ©mon. Por temÃ¡tica, ""entiendo"" que no hayan mÃ¡s, pero espero ver de vuelta a muchas criaturas en futuras entregas de temÃ¡tica mÃ¡s moderna.- Una mejor banda sonora. Muchos temas de Arceus eran remixes de Diamante y Perla, y tampoco es que fueran mejores que los originales. Es el juego con peor banda sonora que recuerdo de la saga o que sea mÃ¡s olvidable.- Zonas mÃ¡s variadas en temÃ¡tica y que tengan una mayor inmersiÃ³n y interÃ©s a la hora de ser exploradas.Y eso es todo. Si Game Freak acaba actualizando el juego, que sÃ© yo, sacando modo PVP o mÃ¡s criaturas, alguna zona extra mÃ¡s Ãºnica a modo de expansiÃ³n, etc, quizÃ¡s la nota suba. Al final, lo que le ha faltado en parte son cosas que ya tenÃ­amos y que aquÃ­ se han visto sustituidas por la temÃ¡tica del propio juego.",18-Feb-22,7,1,1,1,0
766,"I've played about 40 hours of Legends: Arceus. It's a good game. Is there a lot that could've been done better? Absolutely. Are there some things they should've expanded upon? Yes. Is it a step in the right direction though? Certainly.The gameplay is arguably the most important aspect of a game, and I am happy to say that what Legends: Arceus provided is strangely satisfying. When looking at trailers, you may be concerned that the environments have nothing to really explore. This is somewhat true. The terrain can be a bit dull at times, but there are also times where you'll find yourself wandering into this hidden corner of the map, and you'll be rewarded by various things. Even when the terrain isn't too interesting, you'll find that the Pokemon and items you pick up will make up for it. When it comes to the Requests, it can be a bit mixed. Some will be really interesting, slightly comedic in an almost Pokemon anime fashion, or wield some cool rewards. Others, however, will just leave you looking up how to complete it on your phone due to it just being a boring scavenger hunt. I don't mind having to look for stuff, but I think some hints that would narrow down where to search would've made the experience a lot better. The battles with Noble Pokemon can be surprisingly difficult, and has a very consistent difficulty curve. The only one I have issues with is in the Cobalt Coastlands, and that's mostly because the arena makes it feel like you're fluffing your way through it until you finally manage to somehow beat it. It was still fun, but it could've been better. The one in the Alabaster Icelands has to be my favorite. It's hard, but it's a fun type of hard. The trainer battles are, for lack of a better description, interesting. At the beginning of the story, it's very basic, and comparable to Sword and Shield's battling. By the time you get to the post game though, it leans more towards the ""almost unfair"" territory you'd expect from Cynthia in Platinum, and arguably beyond that. The battling itself has changed a lot in this game, and my feelings on it are a bit mixed. On one side, it adds a bit of strategy that was appreciated, on the other side, it can seem a bit unfair and annoying, especially when some Pokemon out-speed you right out the gate. The new status effects are actually pretty cool, and I wouldn't mind if they were implemented into Generation 9. The crafting is also a nice touch, and surprisingly well balanced. Overall I give gameplay an 8/10.The story is fairly average, until you get to the post game. A lot of it feels like it could've gone deeper, or been explained with less presses of the ""A"" button. I think two things that Game Freak should learn in the future is to show rather than tell, and to not repeat a single point several times. It's better than it was in Sword and Shield, but it still needs some work. The last plot point in the post game was definitely worth it though. The story is a 7/10 for me.Do not expect the best in Legend: Arceus' graphics and animation. Some terrain from far away can look downright ugly, and not properly portray what's actually out there. For instance, if you look at The Heartwood from The Heights Base Camp, almost all of the trees are nonexistent. The anti-aliasing can also be really weird at times, especially around water. The animations department is actually a bit better in comparison. It isn't quite Monster Hunter levels, but most of the animations are good enough to keep you immersed. There are times (mostly while doing requests) where it's somewhat obvious that they took some shortcuts, but it's nowhere near as bad as Sword and Shield. 5/10 for graphics and animations.The music is one of Legends: Arceus' high points. It's blissful when you go into The Heartwood or traverse the lands at night, because the music just brings you in. Sometimes you don't want to battle Pokemon just so you can hear some of these tracks without interruption. There are two tracks that play in the Cobalt Coastlands that takes me out of the mood though. ""Cobalt Coastlands 1"" and ""Cobalt Coastlands 1 (Version 2)"" are references the Diamond and Pearl's ""Route 210"" track, and while it fits Diamond and Pearl's tracks, it doesn't really fit the feel you get in the Cobalt Coastlands, which is a ""nice, chill day at the beach, but with a pinch of danger"". The music has more of a ""sprint to the adventure ahead"" sort of feel. There are also times where I felt that the ""Battle! (Wild PokÃ©mon)"" track got a bit repetitive. Maybe if there were slight variations depending on where you were, that would've made it a lot better. There was also this one trainer battle that I wish had some more dramatic music to it instead of the normal trainer theme. All of these are nit-picks though, and didn't in the way of my enjoyment much. An 8/10.Overall, I hope that Generation 9 and future Legends titles (if there are any) improve upon this and make something truly great. There's promise here.",23-Feb-22,7,1,1,1,0
767,"Although this game is a good one compared to bdsp, i do not understand how people can call it a 10/10. I ve played the game around 40 hours or so and i have to say the only thing that makes this game enjoyable are the mechanics. The story is a solid 3/10 at best, and the graphics are truly horrific. Im a fan of old games and dont care about graphics but visual bugs and disappearing assets are truly bad.

768,"You all probably know what's good about this game already, so I'll go ahead and just list some negatives that have impacted my overall impression of it.- Subpar graphics. Breath of the Wild looked way better than this back when it was released, five years ago.- Low framerate. It's 30 at best, but often far below that.- The camera is constantly shifting on its own, and there's no way to make it stay in place.- Empty world. Aside from pokÃ©mon wandering around and some farming points, there's nothing else to find anywhere. No trainers, no points of interest, no treasure chests, etc.- You can't switch pokÃ©mon inbetween turns in battle.- Story NPCs and wild pokÃ©mon can fight you using several pokÃ©mon at once, but you're stuck using a single one even in those battles. Having to go 1 vs 3 isn't uncommon.- Unless you're fine with wasting precious money to buy pokÃ© balls, you'll have to craft your own. This, in turn, means that you'll end up having to farm resources, which is more than a little tedious.- To actually add a complete entry for a pokÃ©mon in your pokÃ©dex, you need to fulfill som criteria, like catching a certain number of that pokÃ©mon, defeating a certain number of that pokÃ©mon, and so on. It might seem like a fun addition on paper, but being forced to do more or less the same tasks over and over and over again for every single pokÃ©mon gets annoying pretty quickly.- The ""flying mount"" isn't actually flying but rather just gliding, making it borderline useless for travel unless you start off on a high plateau.- Clunky controls while riding mount.- Even if you're close enough to an enemy to focus on it, that doesn't mean your pokÃ© ball will reach it. You'll often be a few inches off, alerting the pokÃ©mon to your presence and potentially make it turn aggressive.- A lot of pokÃ©mon have a very long aggro range, making them impossible to approach unless you sneak up on them from behind.- Sneaking is extremely slow, so the pokÃ©mon you're approaching will most likely have turned around and noticed you by the time you're close enough to actually hit it with a ball.- If you're hiding in grass and throw a pokÃ© ball that then fails to catch a pokÃ©mon, you'll be noticed and probably attacked by that pokÃ©mon even if you're still hidden and should be impossible to find.- Boss fights against frenzied (yellow) pokÃ©mon are godawful. The dodge mechanic is clunky at best, and the window of opportunity for sending a pokÃ©mon in to fight the boss after it's been injured enough is frustratingly narrow. Unless you do it basically the same second the message pops up on screen, the pokÃ© ball will just bounce off and the boss will recover. What this means is that you'll usually be stuck slowly whittling away the boss' entire HP with throwable items.",05-Feb-22,6,0.2,11,11,3.3

I really thought features like accessing PC from anywhere and infinite bag space was forecasting what we would have going forward in the series. Nope, they decided to make those things more restrictive than ever. Collecting items to craft what I need is tedious and intentionally time consuming. Clearing my bag because I can?t hold anything else is incredibly frustrating. Those are the biggest things making this game less enjoyable than it could be, but there?s so much more I could mention if I felt like spending hours typing it out. Not a bad game, but could be SO much better.",29-Jan-22,6,0.113636364,4,5,0
775,"PROS:- decent story- fun gameplay restructure- pokedex log tasks that are intuitive and entertaining- crafting mechanics that tie into open-world gathering- you get to ride a menagerie of impressive pokemon and the platforming is decent- new evolutions for old favorites- slick battle animations- item management/""survival"" aspects with punishing consequences- ""stealth"" mechanics that add another layer of skill to catching and/or battling wild PokemonCONS:- short of establishing a new camp or farming plot, all side quest rewards are virtually useless and a few of them will require an unpleasant amount of your time to accomplish (sloppy/lazy gameplay padding)- the game has very little content compared to other entries in the series (~40 hours)- postgame has little purpose, it's just a dex-grind- no multiplayer/PvP- there is only a handful of trainer battles, 98% of battles will be wild pokemon encounters- ""boss fights"" are essentially janky, unmemorable minigames- mediocre graphics that have no excuse for running the system so hot while looking so badVERDICT:It's clear that the game (albeit somewhat successful) is a market test.

776,"So, there's a lot I really like, but there might be just a tad more that I dislike. Idk if I were to give it a rating probably like a 6. Overall it's fun, but it's mechanics get a bit boring after a little and the story and graphics are worse than games from 15 years ago. The story doesn't get interesting until you're in like the last arc of the game. I love what they did with the game and, if they were to expand upon it in sequels, the legends subseries will certainly be my preferred way to play Pokemon. But as it stands idk..",21-Feb-22,6,1,7,7,8.4
777,"Pokemon Legends: Arceus had a great deal of potential leading up to release, but the end product is sadly lacking.It's nice to see a major attempt to revitalize the age-old formula that's remained largely unchanged since the Gameboy, but the execution is muddled. Catching Pokemon in real-time feels great, alongside the overhauled battle system, but the content of Arceus is simply too repetitive to be enjoyed in the long term. The open world environments are only really fun to explore the first time around. The variety is really lacking, and the Pokedex system requiring multiple captures and interactions with the same creature makes the experience a bit of a slog.The style of the game is initially appealing, a game set in the distant past of the Sinnoh region is conceptually very compelling. Unfortunately, Arceus fails to live up to it's premise and it's world and environments tend to be totally without life and character. There's only a single proper town, and there's very little in the way of meaningful interaction here. The graphics are noticeably subpar for an official Nintendo release, with plenty of minor visual bugs to distract you from the experience.The story is another letdown, as throughout the game's considerable length nothing of note really happens. It's a very basic set of events, but the game can't help itself from including walls upon walls of text. The characters are really not at all memorable, and only serve basic story functions before being left to the wayside. This is a shame, as many of the characters are really well designed, and several represent the ancestors of characters from Diamond and Pearl, which is a pretty interesting concept; so it's a shame that they feel like such a throwaway element of the experience. Although I was initially quite excited to learn about the world Legends: Arceus takes place in, this enthusiasm quickly fizzled over the game's playtime and the story petered out in a disappointingly obvious and expected way.I wish that I could separate the disappointing parts of Arceus from it's promising new gameplay formula, but that's simply not possible. The new gameplay style could be a great new direction for the series, but it's simply too repetitive in this current iteration to be compelling past the first few times you experience it. It's also a major letdown to see how utterly lifeless the world, characters, and story are, as these elements had the potential to be legitimately compelling and explore the world of Sinnoh in exciting new ways. Legends: Arceus is probably worth checking out if you're a fan of the series and want to see a new take on the gameplay formula, but don't expect much more than that.",18-Feb-22,6,0.5,89,90,8.6
778,"Without doubt, a step in the right direction. The open world approach is simply the correct way to go with such a franchise.It looks awful. The pop-in is terrible. Some textures are legitimately PS2 quality. If you look up at the sky and then look at your feet, the frame rate drops. Considering that Breath of the Wild, a 2017 game, can run a much better looking, much more stylized world with much better performance on the Switch, this is just embarrassing. The Pokemon in the wild don't seem to do much all, and are not organic, e.g. compared to a deer in Red Dead Redemption 2. I will not be told to compare this game with BotW or RDR2, because Pokemon makes a **** of money every goddamn year. It is simply the biggest franchise ever, think bigger than GTA, RDR, Zelda, Star Wars, Marvel, etc. They are bound to deliver something better to their fans. It doesn't even have voice acting because they don't want to spend the money!What I want to see next time:* A fully open world (not different sections as here) with actual people and towns and buildings;* Actual missions and quests other than catch this many Pokemon (those are just fetch quests)* All Pokemon included, animated and full of character,* Battles, gyms, badges, and a Pokemon league with good AI,* Better resolution, textures, frame rate and overall performance.Before that I just cannot give this a positive score.",13-Feb-22,6,1,39,41,8.1
779,"PLA is a fun game that is really rough around the edges. There are parts of the game that make me kinda want the game to get on with it and parts where I was actually engaged with the story. With that said the game play felt very bare-bones and repetitive making me wish that there was more to it.Story: 7For a Pokemon game, the story in this one is actually pretty decent even though I feel they had to use leaps in logic for why people act or why conflict sometimes happen in order to progress the story forward, which isn't a bad thing, just isn't groundbreaking in its own right. Just happy to have stakes in a Pokemon game again.Sound: 6There wasn't much music that really stood out to me mostly because I swear i couldn't hear it overthe Pokemon in the wild, the ending song is really good though.Graphics: 5I agree with everyone else that the graphics of the game itself isn't really that good and for the largest media franchise in the world, they could have stepped them up. But at the end of the day, it could have been a lot worse than we actually got.Game play: 6The game play is fun at the beginning, but the main issue with it is the fact that it's pretty much the same thing throughout the entire game, with the only break in the monotony being the boss fights which were genuinely fun to fight against because it wasn't just a regular Pokemon battle.Final Score: 6/10PLA is a step in the right direction for the Pokemon franchise, and I really want to see what they do next with this type of game play style.

783,"This game takes players on an extraordinary adventure in an ancient, Japanese themed world of Pokemon! Where you get the chance to befriend the legendary Pokemon Arceus! Let's hope everyone forgot about Pokemon Conquest so we can make that sound more original. OK, to be fair...I don't hate this game. I think this a great reimagining of Sinnoh. Its not the remake I wanted, but I still had a pretty good time. I was hesitate at first, discovering that the final Sinnoh remake was going to be a spin-off game really disappointed. I mean in Let's Go, the catching mechanics are vastly different compared to other games but they were easy to learn and its a lot like the original Pokemon games where everyone could learn ""Reflect"". But this a whole new Pokemon world...brand new catching mechanics and an altered battle system. It's all diverse. And while the battle system is OK at best, I'm really impressed with the new catching mechanics. Stalking careless Pokemon in the tall grass like a true hunter and then smashing them in the back for the capture...its really satisfying! It's definitely the game's biggest strength. This game definitely isn't for battle fans, but it was rather designed for those who love to complete the Pokedex. It's a world with no version exclusives and trade items are equivalent evolution stones. Nothing's holding you back this time to catch all of those pocket monsters. Personally my favorite part of this experience was probably the Alpha Pokemon. They remind me of some old PokePark memories. Only these Pokemon aren't pissed off, they want to tear you to shreds! It's so exhilarating trying to catch these guys. They roar so loud that its sends your character flying. The added size and the glowing red eyes really adds to intimidation. It looks a lot like the classic Mystery Dungeon box art. It's just gives me another reason to love them. They are over-leveled and are as strong as most legendaries, which makes it all the more satisfying to build a team out of them. Do you know how awesome it is to build a team made of Alpha Sinnoh starters, it's like a dream come true. And I'll also shout out, the reason I call this is a ""reimagined Sinnoh"" is because if you listen carefully...you can hear remixed level themes from Diamond and Pearl all across the game. Eterna Forest, Mt. Coronet, the works! The Celestica Flutes sound just like the old title screens. And there's plenty of Sinnoh Pokemon to set a nice, familiar tone to the game. I like the new Pokemon forms fine, but it puts a greater smile on my face to see hundreds of Sinnoh Pokemon spread across the land, INCLUDING the Platinum entries. Yes, move over half-asked Diamond and Pearl remakes...THIS is how its done! Well...for the most part the game is great. Even with my half broken controller and a few sprite glitches I was still having a fun ride, but the charm of the characters started to wear off after I defeated Avalugg. I bet a lot of people question this part when they back at the game. Why the hell does Commander Kamado kick you out of the village? For some reason, he suddenly accuses you, the child suffering from amnesia, who has been doing nothing but help Team Galaxy, and save the Nobles...for causing the distortion threatening the region of Hisui. At this point of the game a lot a scene in the story feel forced. The Commander suddenly turns into an antagonist and there's some extra backstory for the Charm Sisters. And I just don't care. Some of the boss fights in this game were annoying and I'm not a fan of all the side quests...but those are just nitpicks. An RPG game doesn't need a breathtaking story to be good, but Kamado's motivation is childish. It feels like the writers just made his character an antagonist because the first climax wasn't exciting enough. This is just as weak as Sword and Shield's antagonist. And as for Volo as the true villain, I have to ask...did anyone care? The final fight takes place after the main story credits, so most players are likely to miss out on it. Its not really built up well and sadly, like the new Cynthia in the remakes, the developers make this fight unnecessarily difficult in order to entertain older fans. I like difficult Pokemon challenges, but do you really think the battle system was a highlight in this game? The game starts to feel smaller when I started to climb Mount Coronet. Not putting the effort to remake the Distortion World, or summit level longer was a huge missed opportunity. I can't listen to the sweet remix if the level one takes a minute to climb! The main gimmicks are a lot more entertaining than the conclusions. The characters are vibrant an dit feels good to build a team of my favorite Pokemon. But this game really needs something more if it wants to be remembered. Hopefully, the DLC this time around will be worth purchasing. Because this is the most fun I've had with a modern Pokemon game in years. I hope that Gamefreak will return to greatness someday. One step at a time.",16-Feb-22,6,0,62,118,5.9
784,"The underrating shouldn't not be everyone, only E10+. What's with the rating pending, and this could be harmful for little children.The story is like parental guidance, and the gameplay is like Monster Hunter World or Rise, like open-world or zone. The game frame rate is not enough to adjust 60fps and 1080p, and the graphic is too similar as Sword and Shield. However, the music, open-world area, and quests that I like is much better. Like music, it was very calm and peace that I can relax my brain without expressing anger. I can believe you don't have enough strong graphic and frame rate is because I'm very disappoint that you put low quality. Even though you compared the Breath of the Wild, the only you compare is Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter Rise. IS this a hub system?!The battle mechanic is not bad, strong and agile is much combination, but I'm confuse about the turns. Also, the moves were too small, so I am disappoint that all the moves about 75% are gone!!!!!The difficulty of battling is tricky and everyone thing they can't win a higher level, like post-ending, it will start over without check point. The 3d modeling is doesn't make sense, like Pokemon has different colors and it's confusing (think it is shiny). No more trade evolve, YAY!!!!!! The fans think the trade evolve would get stolen and refuse to give it back. I'm impress you add new items, like linking cord.Returning to quest, the money is too low, and the rank progress is too slow when progressing the story. Also, wasting poke balls that you catch is a limit amount, and you'll waste and buy it again.I think the Game Freak is using the same graphic that the AAA's are having a technical issues, rather than finding a good engine to create their own by themselves.

787,"Playing Legends Arceus was fun. Game Freak finally tried something new, improved the gameplay make it feel faster and some more positive things. Its the right direction for the pokemon franchise and hopefully a bunch of improvements will find there way in the main Pokemon games.As good as the gameplay, story and direction was, you cant ignore the technical and graphical problems about this game and it should be called out and criticized. The art style is not the problem. It looks really good when you find the right camera angle. When you look at the world of Pokemon Legends Arceus and compare it to similar games with their worlds like a Monster Hunter Rise on the switch, or even other exclusives like Xenoblade 2, Pokemon Snap, the upcoming Kirby game and Zelda Botw and many more, Legends Arceus looks awful as if this game is a Steam pre alpha game or even a N64 game when you compare some areas with a Zelda Ocarina of Time. There are a lot of pop ups of trees etc, the main town is the only one in game and most houses are just copy and paste, awful environmental visuals, a lot of areas feel very empty and there are also nearly no points of interests for a game that wants to you to explore the world.Of course there is no need to have a game with next gen graphics or a more realism look, but you have to have in mind that this game is a product of a big video game company with the biggest franchise in the world. They generate millions of dollars and cant deliver a game with a visual standard that fits the size and popularity of the franchise Pokemon. Game Freak has the finances to get help by other studios like every game does nowadays, even a Halo, Horizon etc. gets help by many different studios. The console is not the problem as you can see all the way better looking exclusives on the switch. And when there is a lot of crunch time its a company decision to put the games on the market in a high frequency with just the essential content and visuals to get enough positive scores by media and the games sold.Overall the game makes quite fun because it uses a fresh optimized gameplay and going another way than the main games, but you have do decide if you want to spend your money for a game that looks like a game that is stucked in the past of the Xbox360/PS3 era or even at some point lower. Compared to other actual games it feels like completely low effort product with no details and soul.At the end its a decision whether you want to support this course of the company Game Freak or want to see a way bigger change of the biggest franchise in the world.",29-Jan-22,6,0.104166667,1,1,0
788,"The game is promising, but not really worth a full $60. The graphics are poorly optimized still - Sword & Shield actually looks better. No promising change on the battle system with exception of you as the trainer moving around - thus, taking out the multiplayer was completely unnecessary. Dumbed down to 242 pokes in the region, which may upset alot of other trainers. Catching mechanic lacks potential - cut the middle man between traditional & Lets Go. Stealth mechanic is poor - better off just catching on foot or battle. Story is an average Pokemon story, with minor grim tales.

789,"Legends Arceus is an expensive tech demo through and through. Through the past several years in the transition from 2D sprite work to 3D models GameFreak's made the risky move of turning Pokemon into a console title. With that shift has come a noticeable drop in quality, particularly in the department which manages the compatibility between titles. Sword and Shield had a reduced Pokedex and rather sparse content and Legend's Arceus follows suit by delivering a really unique playstyle overshadowed by a game generally devoid of content. The ancient world of Sinnoh is bland and misses a lot of the diverse biomes that typically populate a Pokemon game on top of generally feeling empty as a whole. If you love Pokemon you'll probably still enjoy this game as I did but I can't shake the feeling this game should've released as a free demo with the team dedicating more time to fleshing out the world, the missions and the overall Pokemon experience. I'm not sure if GameFreak is just looking for a cash grab or has just grown plain lazy but Legend's Arceus will hopefully not set a precedent and is just paving the way for a much better game down the road.",30-Jan-22,6,0.1875,1,1,0

Ahora, puedes tocar el principio del himno de AndalucÃ­a con la flauta, 10/10 en sonido.-AmbientaciÃ³n: Not bad cuando te haces a los gÃ¡ficos, si que consigue cierta inmersiÃ³n y a ratos parece que realmente estÃ¡s teniendo la experiencia que han publicitado y que los fans pedÃ­amos, no sabrÃ­a si ponerle entre el 6-7. Aunque si antes eran los entrenadores los que estaban esperando meses en el mismo sitio a que tu pasaras a enfrentarte a ellos, ahora son los pokemons, con spawns fijos, sin movilidad e interacciÃ³n entre ellos, si eso alguno que duerme y poco mÃ¡s.-Jugabilidad: Es muy divertido, las nuevas mecÃ¡nicas encajan bien y me tienen enganchado aÃºn, creo que es la primera vez que voy a completar la pokedex ya que no me aburro capturando, por lo que para mi es el mÃ¡s divertido hasta la fecha, le pondrÃ­a un 9.-Contenido: No se si hay mÃ¡s postgame del que estoy haciendo, pero si lo que buscas son combates y estrategia, por ahora no es el juego, hay 7 u 8 combates contados en la historia y con la dificultad perfecta para que mi perro los juegue por mi. El nÃºmero de la pokedex me parece correcto, ya que no abruma, pero se nota mucho el tijeretazo al contenido base para vender el DLC en unos meses, el cual si incluye el pvp y algÃºn modo de combates pve que asciendan en dificultad, muy a mi pesar lo comprarÃ© ya que convertirÃ­a este pokemon en el mejor que se ha hecho, con todos sus fallos, pero que ahoramismo es sÃ³lo historia.-HistorÃ­a: estÃ¡ bien, no es una peli de Tarantino pero consigue que le prestes atenciÃ³n a ratos, aunque los incesantes cuadros de texto rompen el ritmo de juego y desesperan a cualquiera,el tutorial son 3-4 horas de sufrimiento pero despuÃ©s se abre el juego y es muy disfrutable.RESUMEN: Si buscas una experiencia parecida a la serie de la infancia, con pokemons por ahÃ­ sueltos y un mundo por explorar, es tu juego, si buscas un rpg por turnos como hasta ahora era la franquicia, no te lo recomiendo, ahoramismo es un pokemon snap con algunos combates, pero con la potencialidad de convertirse en el mejor hasta la fecha por los cambios en los ivs, el sistema de ataque y turnos, el cambio a las MT y a la ""memoria"" y personalidades de los pokemons, que vuelven el competitivo mucho mas accesible (si es que lo instauran). Por lo que para mi serÃ­a un 5-6 comparandolo con la competencia, un 7 si miramos de donde viene la franquicia y el cambio que propone, un ""must have"" para los fans como yo (y me duele), y si con nuevo contenido hay mÃ¡s combates y un competitivo decente, que motive al jugador a algo mÃ¡s que a completar la pokedex, creo que serÃ¡ el mejor juego de la IP hasta la fecha.PerdÃ³n por el tocho, espero que le sea Ãºtil a alguien, me voy a capturar Eevees para evolucionarlos.",02-Feb-22,6,0.555555556,1,1,0

802,"This game is a step in a new and exciting direction, but the world feels eerily dead and unfinished.For example, there is a severe lack of music when running around the map. The pokemon just stand around staring into space instead of playing/chasing each other. The pokemon species all just kind of spawn in groups at certain spots, without much variation. The graphics are rather poor. You can finish the main story in about 10 hours. Like with most pokemon games its too easy.There are some cool things about it though, especially the open world aspect. There are also fairly challenging events with rare pokemon, shiny pokemon to catch, and quite a few legendaries to catch.I enjoyed it, but yeah, something about the emptiness really puts me off the game.",01-Mar-22,6,0,1,1,0

You catch them all and that's all, you don't need to train them because even bosses can be beaten without even using a single PokÃ©mon. And the joke is that they all are wining experience even if you didn't use them.Battle system is a mess and left so much to be desired like: enemy pokemon is poisoned, I use calm mind to buff myself for the next PokÃ©mon, their pokemon use agile style and attack, their pokemon die to poison and another comes in, new pokemon uses quick attack, new pokemon uses agile style attack, new pokemon attacks again and when my turn is finally here... Calm mind effect expired. A joke. I understand now why there's no held items or abilities. They surely need to improve this in future games.Also story is bland, the postgame is epic, but doesn't makes much sense and... The tutorial is the longest this franchise has.

808,"So the game is very fun at first but the luster wears off badly as it goes. Initially I rated the game an 8 but as you play, you see the ugly visuals, battling is terrible in this game, the style system is horrible, barely any moves, lots of battles where it's you versus multiple Pokemon that can all potentially have multiple turns each before you can even do anything, you can send in a Pokemon and have it die without even moving if it's slow because of the styles. The boss battles are a mess, the first couple are fine but by the 3rd you start to wonder what the designers were thinking, certain attacks are basically impossible to dodge and it goes against the idea of the game being more simple(SPOILER example, Arcanine, it's whole thing is it dashes across an arena with lava and you have to leave enough space to dodge him, fine, then he just puts a massive fire ring in the middle of the arena that completely blocks anywhere to dodge sideways as he tackles, but if you go in the ring you die, it's a mechanic that makes no sense and just feels frustrating and cheap because it doesn't require you to react or dodge more, you just can't move out of the way of his attacks at that point but it's just dodging a tackle still). Like they took all the fun and complexity out of the actual Pokemon battles but the boss fights are a nightmare of poorly designed attacks to try to dodge while throwing balms. There are also a lot of small irritating things like 1 save file or how small the satchel is in a game where you're supposed to be constantly gathering things. The game is fun when you're just out catching Pokemon but it has a huge laundry list of problems that only Pokemon could ever get away with , like any other company or game series would be dragged for a game with this many issues and outdated systems.",14-Feb-22,5,0.5,7,7,4.1

816,"Overall for a PokÃ©mon Game the changes they made were exactly what we have been waiting for for years. The issues start once you realize though this is not a Open World Game and technically even less Open World than previous games.They straight up stole the World System from Monster Hunter where you have a Central Hub filled with NPCs you can converse with, merchants, and crafting capabilities; of which they didn't really even use recipes they already have(for example only brown apricots are in the game preventing the acquisition of pokeballs such as the Love ball or Premier Ball). and then Exploration Zones, which are just Wild Area's from Sword and Shield, but Larger. The Alpha PokÃ©mon are just permanent weaker versions of Dynamaxing, which is nice but not really anything new, they are supposed to come with special moves but those same moves can just be bought from the move trainer for money.Money, never thought a PokÃ©mon game would make money redundant, but I wasted my first 2 Million just buying moves for PokÃ©mon I ended up releasing back into the Wild eventually. Some recipes cost money, and can be costly(upwards of 50,000 so far), but I made 2 Million before I even quelled the first Noble. You don't need to buy pokeballs or potions or their upgraded versions, cause you can just craft them. Bag Space is kind of expensive after awhile but after the first 15 upgrades I've never had an issue with running out of space before needing to go rest and recover pp.The game isn't even anywhere close to Open World. The Central Hub is separated by a loading screen between every region, regions of which you can not travel between without going back to the Central Hub, and walking into buildings causes loading screens. That is a Closed World. They have Wild PokÃ©mon spotting's where a group of something specific will spawn in larger numbers, but that only happens to 1 region at a time, and only when you go back to the Central Hub. They also have these things called Time Distortions which summon Evolution Items, stronger PokÃ©mon perfect for level grinding, and coloured plates and star dust which can be crafted together into star pieces. But only 3 or 4 will spawn in a region at a time, afterwards you're forced to go back to the Central Hub again if you want more of these to spawn. Before going back to town, your also forced to turn in all of your currently finished research, which gives you money and xp towards your Star Rank.The Star Ranks. What was the purpose of these, I was 7 Star and all PokÃ©mon of all levels would obey my command before I even quelled Kleavor, that's the equivalent of 2 Gym Badges in previous games. Which means by time I actually got into the Mirelands, every one of my PokÃ©mon, which I collect 1 of each one in their Alpha Form and Shiny Forms, were all 1 hitting everything, including the Noble of the Mirelands, the Miss Fortune Sisters, and all the ""Trainers""Trainers, where are all my trainers at? I've rushed to unlock Braviary and now stopping to actually perfect the Dex, but like where are the trainers at? you fight a handful of Leaders and Wardens of the Diamond and Pearl Clan, and even give out Balls and PokÃ©mon to people to start them out, but the only real trainer encounter is the Miss Fortune Sisters who Ambush you from time to time.WHERE IS MY FOLLOWER POKEMON!!! Like seriously, Yellow, HeartGold, SoulSilver, Lets Go, These were some of your best games because of the follower PokÃ©mon, stop removing that feature!Combat Evolved? I noticed and love the fact that you went out of your way and removed redundant moves such as Harden, and condensed them into their other more significant abilities like Iron Defense, but where's the PokÃ©mon Combat? This would have been a perfect game to allow us to control our PokÃ©mon during battle and do combat like an RPG instead of turn based. Dodge, Block, Attack, all of that could have easily been done instead of being able to run around during combat as the trainer, kind of redundant there and a little useless for a feature.Although yes I did say this was the game we've been waiting for for years, I have to lower my rating because of the fact they keep removing features of their series that actually did very well and attracted people to their game. All-in-all I have spent over 100 hours on the game already and have perfect 115 / 242 available currently. Hopefully with future updates and dlc they can fix some issues and maybe try and actually make an open world game, not just claim it to be one and steal the concept from someone else.",09-Feb-22,5,0.5,2,2,0

I?ve been playing, and playing, and playing, for 15 hours. Is it a bad game? Not at all, but I don?t think it?s good either. My main complaint is battles, they are completely ruined, the system is just all over the place, there?s absolutely no balance, I hate the new ?styles?? I never use them. PokÃ©mon in battle attack you twice something just because (NO styles used), sometimes even 3 times, abilities would help with battles but they don?t exist etc. I just feel like battles are a complete mess.And that?s wild PokÃ©mon battles, because proper battles with trainers don?t exist (you have some battles every 10 years with a trainer who uses 1 freaking PokÃ©mon, 1!)The areas are ?too big??imo. It?s not a bad thing, but it?s extremely confusing and sometimes annoying and I lose interest on exploring because everything is the same but with a different PokÃ©mon walking around. I know some people love massive open areas, but it?s not my cup of tea, I like something more in the middle.The crafting is annoying, way worse is the satchel limit, that you have to pay a TON of money to get just 1 more spot for an item??wtf.I won?t talk about the graphics, we all know they?re not the best, and they didn?t really bother me, for me it was other stuff that was worse than that, as mentioned before.There?s way too much talking, nonsense talking, way too much. I find it dumb af you can?t go from one area to the other, you HAVE to go back to the camp every single time, to request to go to the village, and then again request to go to another area. That?s just dumb and a waste of time, can?t believe they pulled this on us.You can?t change PokÃ©mon and access to your objects to store them, it is mandatory to go back to the camp (again) to do so, not much qol there??and don?t even get me started on losing a ton of objects when you pass out.I absolutely miss BATTLES, real ones. I absolutely miss GYMS, having a more ?marked??objective, and go to the PokÃ©mon League etc??some people may like the type of game Legends is, but PokÃ©mon has been always about battles, gyms, the league and being a PokÃ©mon master. The best.I play when i?m bored, when I stop playing, it takes a lot for me to go back to the game, doesn?t really hook me. I force myself to play to at least finish it (game wasn?t for free).I have to say I love the overworld PokÃ©mon and the possibility to see shynies. I like the battling when you just send the PokÃ©mon and that?s it, it?s very quick and I appreciate that.I personally hope this is just the typical spin off game, it hurts to admit I had way more fun with Sword and Shield. I hope Gen 9 takes the good mechanics about this game like the overworld pokemon, quick in and out battles etc, but it?s more focused on the typical gyms etc??and not so massive areas.Is is the ?best PokÃ©mon game everrrr!??as some people say?

830,"IGN Italy's review is the most accurate critic review of this game. That reviewer understands how to analyze game systems and how they interact with one another, instead of just being mindlessly wowed by an open world with a few genuine improvements to the traditional PokÃ©mon formula. And there really are some improvements. They simply seem to have been made without any consideration whatsoever for how they affect the rest of the game.Let's start with the good. Non-random, seamless battles are great. Want to get into a fight with a wild PokÃ©mon? Toss out one of your own PokÃ©mon near it and bam, you're in battle. No loading screen, no battle transition effect, just instantly in battle mode, and you're still free to move around at will while the battle is going on -- see it from any angle, even get hit by the attacks if you're careless with where you stand.Don't feel like battling? You can catch PokÃ©mon without being in battle now, which is great. Not all of them, mind you, but some of them.These are the two main alterations Game Freak made to the traditional formula. They're good ideas. Unfortunately they have some noticeably bad knock-on effects, which it seems Game Freak either didn't notice, or compensated for in rather amateur ways.Previous PokÃ©mon games had the luxury of hiding all PokÃ©mon in tall grass, and (outside Sword & Shield) never actually showed them in the wild. This means the presence of the PokÃ©mon is part of the player's suspension of disbelief. They're there and they totally have all the behaviors listed in the PokÃ©dex, but you just never see them. Legends Arceus, on the other hand, shows the PokÃ©mon in the wild. And they just...stand there and wander around a bit. They don't live in the world. They have no homes, they have no behaviors, they don't interact with one another -- they simply exist and wait to be caught or fought. This, much more than the obvious visual-fidelity issues, makes the world feel lifeless and oddly empty.Out-of-battle catching speeds up the game to an insane extent. If you could catch everything without fighting it, the game would be over extremely quickly, and Game Freak needed to not let that happen because of the large number of people out there who equate Time Spent with Money Value. It seems Game Freak has implemented two ""solutions"" in order to prevent the game's runtime from being drastically shortened.First, PokÃ©mon fall into three categories: friendly, skittish, and aggressive. Friendly PokÃ©mon can be caught out of battle with no special requirements; just throw a ball. Skittish PokÃ©mon can be caught out of battle, as long as they don't see you first (they'll run away). Aggressive PokÃ©mon cannot be caught outside battle whatsoever, and must be fought and captured in the traditional manner. Game Freak has made MOST PokÃ©mon aggressive. They made a super convenient change to the formula and then set things up to force you through the traditional formula anyway, for the most part.Secondly and far more damningly, the PokÃ©dex requires multiple catches, multiple victorious battles, multiple observations of PokÃ©mon move use, and other checklist items such as ""catch without being seen"", before a dex entry for a specific PokÃ©mon will be ""complete"". There really is no reason or justification provided for what amounts to repetitious busywork; it seems obvious that this is another ""solution"" to the problem of ""we made playing the game faster and more convenient, but we need to keep them playing for roughly the same amount of time as before"". Catching is faster now? Require a lot more catches instead of just the traditional one-and-done. Battling is controllable now, and not at all randomized? Require a specific number of battles for each PokÃ©mon so the player HAS to fight them multiple times anyway. And worse, virtually everything in the game revolves around dex completion, which never gets any more interesting or complex over time. Sidequests ask for complete dex entries outright, or for things you do to complete dex entries. The main quest also requires dex entries. It's a one-note game loop.Game Freak could have done much more interesting things with its good core changes. Make the PokÃ©mon appear to really live in the world. Require the player to observe and record their behaviors: what they eat, where they live. Use the Switch as if it is the dex itself (similar to how BotW treated the tablet as an actual in-game device), and permit the player to directly record dex info, perhaps with fill-in-the-blank fields and a selection of pre-written answer options. In a game where the dex is so central, interesting things to do with the dex seem like a no-brainer. Unfortunately Game Freak settled for ""just make them do the usual stuff, but way more"".

Pokemon is the highest grossing video game series ever and we deserve better.

837,"I've been playing Pokemon since Emerald, and yes I do like the step that they're going to with this game.But out of sheer love for the franchise, I just can NOT ever recommend this game considering how much it costs and the actually quality AND quantity you're getting. I was hoping to be able to give a pass to the horrid graphics if the world itself had something compelling to do in it.But no, what i got was sloppy excuse of mish mash of terrain. Right now i can't even bare to finish it, the game doesn't keep me hooked. Especially not with how grindy the progression feels.The research part is a great and certainly something most fans wanted, but putting it as the only way to progress the story just makes it feel like a chore.""No gamefreak, i don't want to catch this pokemon for 267th time to progress this subpar story""And moving on to the story, it was alright. But again that damn research system shouldn't be the main part, just like the pokedex in previous games it should've just been a side objective that you slowly progress AS you play through the game not vice versa.Now let's talk about the world, if you could even call it that. You know what the open world feels like? Like they spat on my face and said deal with it. Let me ask everyone else who's played, can you name atleast 5 places on the map and say something interesting about them, take away the pokemon roaming around and ask yourself was any of the wilderness area memorable? The answer is noAnd now the roaming pokemon, what else is there to say. They're basic AIs that just so happen to look like pokemon. I'm not expecting a complex simulation of their ecosystem, but they didn't even try to improve on it after SwSh (Sword & Shield)Finally i have to reiterate, i love Pokemon. But rn as things stand, i don't think gamefreak feels the same love towards it.Overall the game is a 5/10, there are good ideas and at least some hope for a better game in the future. But right now Pokemon Legends: Arceus feels like an unfinished, half assed game, with uncooked but great ideas. Do better gamefreak, do better.Unrelated rant about parts of the pokemon community:Like ordering a steak in a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and getting raw beef, you like steak but the chef didn't bother to cook it. You're disappointed by the result but you see everyone else eating the raw beef just because Ramsay did it. You decide to not eat the raw uncooked beef, but everyone else in the restaurant glares at you because of it. That's what the community feels like nowadays, I'm criticizing the games cause i want them to do better. I have no ill intentions, but everyone else feels ok and satisfied with the status quo while demonizing those who are actually passionate and love the pokemon games, ones who want to see it reach it's full potential",31-Jan-22,5,0.466666667,1,1,0

843,"Really let down by the gaming community?s inability to give objective reviews.I was excited about this game from the moment I heard about it a year ago. I really wanted to like it, but as I watched it go through development I saw red flag after red flag.The game seems to suffer from lazy open-world design syndrome; where the illusion of endless opportunity boils down to reveal a game void of meaningful content with redundant and scarce gameplay loops.Seeing the PokÃ©mon in the overworld, having more control over the trainer and their poke-balls, these are great ideas that get people excited. But think about how much is missing; look at the legendary open world games like TES, GTA, and BotW. These games have their base gameplay loops (slinging swords and sorcery, stealing cars) but they come together to support epic overarching stories: guilds, colorful characters, impactful decisions.I had a lot of fun with PokÃ©mon let?s go, and a lot of people complained about that. I think both the games suffer from a lot of the same problems. Hasty development, lazy and uninspired UI, technical issues we didn?t see in their predecessors. But where are the negative reviews for legends? I wanted to like Arceus, but this game clearly didn?t get the budget it would have taken to properly pull off this really great idea. Imagine: guild plotlines like from TES, but you?re working your way up through gyms, saving PokÃ©mon as a ranger, or refining your PokÃ©mon as a breeder. Imagine colorful characters sending you on meaningful adventures and becoming your companions! But no, we get a super boiled down game that feels like one or two years of development work from the B-team.Come on gaming community??tell me with a straight face this is PokÃ©mon breath of the wild??that?s just insulting to the team who put together the masterpiece that is botw. It?s like saying a Honda with a spoiler is the Japanese Ferrari??smhThat being said, I?m optimistic for this franchise going forward. The massively positive response this game has seen (despite its, to me at least, obvious shortcomings) should tip off the game makers that the community is hungry for the types of gameplay that Arceus displayed. I?d maybe pay $30 for this game, but $60? No way.",06-Feb-22,5,0.6,1,1,0

The environment is stale, AI is poor, pop in is horrible for a game about exploring. My biggest complaint is the map. There's no map in the corner and so I find myself constantly opening the map up and on top of that, you can only place one guided marker at a time. It's a refreshing game! It's not hard at all if that's what you want, but I would recommend it. 5 just because it's good but it could have been so much more.

846,"The first novelty that gave me heaviness is seeing all those items to be completed for each single PokÃ©mon in the PokÃ©Dex. Many are repetitive and although it is initially nice to capture them, they gave me a sense of annoyance. You can't stay there for hours behind pokemon to take them from behind, to catch them over and over again. I prefer the classic capture method that I already miss. While continuing it seems to always be in the first area, everything is the same: from the first to the last. Especially after 10h you start to feel the weight of the graphics. The pasture is full of the same pokÃ©mon and after a while you can no longer distinguish. There isn't even a tier order or anything like that. Always talking about order, I can't understand what the tools in my Purse or just the PokÃ©dex are. Quick / powerful moves? Despite these facilities several times you do not lose / gain a turn, stand there each time to press R / L to see who will attack that turn. PokÃ©mon is not obliged to innovate, I did not like the news such as moves, having to fill in all those items (especially because if you do not rise in rank in a situation you cannot continue the story), the graphics, the clutter. If it is to innovate, the focus must be on creatures and the interaction with them.Above all I don't want to rank up to get ultraballs etc and be able to catch strong pokemon. I am limited and forced to register pokemon repetitively, wasting time, just because I cannot continueOst absent except in struggles and in some situations.With the powerful moves you lose all the beauty of pokemon clashes: with one move you knock out the pokemon and you finish everything quickly. Because then people have always complained about the difficulty, game freak has decided to get the exp points only at the end of the fight. For me it makes no sense, it just makes everything more difficult and frustrating because the KO pokemon do not go up by lv (and many will KO)",28-Feb-22,5,0,3,6,6.8
847,"I wasn?t sure what to make of PL:Arceus when it was first announced. On the one hand, GF and TPC appeared to be changing up the battle mechanics & adding real-time elements. On the other hand, its poor graphics and empty overworld left a lot to be desired. It was also unclear whether the game would be an experimental one-off, or an attempt to change/evolve the series??core mechanics. As someone who?s played since the very first titles but finds the latest entries to be stale and disappointing, I went in with very low expectations.Pokemon Legends: Arceus??trailers promised a decent story, and while I can attest that the writing receives more focus than usual, the presentation frankly sucks, as there?s still no voice acting, with most interactions consisting of characters awkwardly standing & talking.The real draws are the revamped combat and catching systems. The changes to gameplay, while not perfect, make Arceus initially far more captivating than its preceding games. First and most importantly, you can aim Poke Balls to interact directly with Pokemon on the field, & while exploring, you?ll be able to easily shuffle who?s next in line to battle, as well as send them to harvest materials from trees, shrubs, and mineral outcroppings, essential for crafting healing items and Poke Balls.Many Pokemon will either run or attack your avatar on sight, so you?ve got options - dodge like it's Dark Souls, sneak around and try to nab them without being spotted, ambush with your Pokemon to start a fight, lure/repel them with food, or run away. You?ll also get multiple Pokemon mounts to ride across the game?s several open areas.Combat is tweaked in many minor ways. While you?ll be dodging occasionally, aside from bosses, you don?t fight Pokemon in real-time, so the traditional four-move, turn-based core combat remains. The game introduces Agile and Strong variations to attacks (faster and weaker VS stronger and slower). Best of all, your Pokemon?s moves can now be easily switched outside of battle, making it infinitely more convenient to swap movesets. It really opens up a lot of possibilities - you can have your starter be a sweeper in one battle, and a defensive mon-catching tool in the next. Held items no longer exist. Status effects are tweaked, with most being weaker, and they thankfully disappear after each battle.These changes, as well as the limited pool of teachable moves, make certain builds, such as dedicated physical and special sweepers, far more effective. It?ll be in your interest to get battles done as quickly as possible, especially since you?ll often find yourself fighting multiple wild Pokemon at once with just one of your own. For the most part, the changes also help the game to flow smoother, since you?ll be covering a lot of ground in the great outdoors, often atop mounted Pokemon. However, due to the kneecapping of potential builds owing to the removal of breeding, and lack of variety in your foes making fine-tuning an afterthought, I grew bored of the battles halfway in.There are no gyms, no breeding, and very few trainer battles. Instead, you?ll spend time gathering/crafting, and on the Pokedex. This time your dex entries don?t end with just catching and trading. You?re also tasked with specific battle tasks. You?ll only need to fulfill ten challenges per Pokemon, so while it isn't daunting, it does feel like busywork.That brings me to the game?s biggest weakness - the world itself - and I don?t just mean the fact that there are limited ways to interact with the environments, or that the 242 Pokemon are a mixed bag of species. While the Pokemon models are often well-animated, the day-night and weather cycles add variety, and the game runs smoothly with minimal loading, there?s no sugarcoating the fact that the graphics and environments are subpar, featuring empty worlds, trees & textures that would look bad on the GameCube, pop-in and heavy aliasing, & a bland color palette tempered by muted art direction.It's a testament to the strength of Arceus??core mechanics that the bland environments, lack of trainer battles, and unfinished feel of the game don?t completely sink the experience. Perhaps it?s because my expectations were so low going in, but I can safely say that in spite of its many faults, Arceus is the most fun I?ve had with a Pokemon title since the days of the DS. It also shows that the franchise in general still has potential. That may sound like faint praise from someone who has been critical of the mainline franchise for years, but I think most fans will appreciate the real-time elements, the easily-swappable movesets, and the additions to the world-building and lore. My only hope is that Nintendo is able to build upon what was established in this title and utilize it to take the franchise forward in a bold new direction.

865,"Here is a game that on paper gets me excited for a Pokemon game. After years and years of the same repeated game with different skins comes a new game that tries to be different. The problem is that each new idea feels cut short and never truly fleshed out. The visuals are boring and flat. People seem to confuse ""graphics"" with things like ultra realism or RTX but that is not what I am speaking about. A game can have simple graphics but still manage to set itself apart and look visually interesting. This game needs voice acting of some kind. The lack of voice acting just feels low budget and boring. Even a grunt would bring it up a point in my book at this point. The game play is fun and I would have enjoyed the open movement to play a bigger part in the battles. I think we are at a point where we can start to move away from the turn base battles. Final fantasy had a great solution in its remake where it could be toggled on for those who enjoy it but was not forced onto the player. Combat could be so much more by doing it real time. Heck even just getting rid of the one Pokemon limit when battling would be an improvement! It feels like they picked this time period so that they could finally do something different with the Pokemon formula but then chose not lean into it fully and we are left with half baked new features that just leave us wanting more. Hopefully this game will lead a future where Pokemon games can be something more than just an advertisement to sell merchandise!",29-Jan-22,4,0.276190476,1,1,0

876,"A game that only Pokemon fans would tolerate.No other game could be this much of a technical disaster and still garner so much praise. Only Pokemon. Graphics, sound design, level design, NPCs, and more are so undercooked that I would have guessed this game was a year away from release.The gameplay loop is fun enough: go out into the zones and catch Pokemon. Level them up, evolve them. Fill out your Pokedex. The same fun loop that Pokemon is built on, but opened up to larger zones (not open world). I'm happy that many fans are enjoying this. But wow, that is where my praise ends.The graphics are well documented as being the worst of any AAA game in recent years. It's hard to overstate how bad they are. This is the ugliest major release of any IP I can remember. There is also no voice overs, or even the typical JRPG grunting. Just silence during conversations.The open zone level design is a nice change, but it is marred by the game's ugliness. Not to mention basic, fun features like a following Pokemon or the ability to look at your newly caught Pokemon's stats in the field are absent. NPCs are also copy/pasted across the game, which is sad considering there are maybe 100 of them, if that.I just don't understand how this game can be celebrated. Pokemon fans deserve better.

877,"Pokemon Legends: Arceus is a failed experiment BUT a solid and promising begining for a new era of the franchise.Let's start with the good things:- The new set-up teams mechanic is pretty good in a way that the movesets are changeable all the time which gives you the oportunity to prepare difficult combats. Note: There are not difficult combats, but for the future is WAY beyond interesting.- I like the idea of introducing new types of attacks (strong and agile).- The concept of the pokemon missions is addictive, making the game more enjoyable trying to complete the tasks of your favorite pokemons.- Capturing is not my favorite mechanic, because i rather combat, but it's pretty satisfying and well done.Bad things:- The story and it's narrative is so dumb in a way that the characters are flattering you because you capture a lvl2 pokemon and they couldn't. I mean, you where there for 5min and you did what they couldn't for their entire life, it's just ridiculous. Another dumb thing is the ""Professor"" character. How in the hell can be someone a professor if you just can't study the pokemons? what can you teach? Ignoring all of this, the story just feels like an anime issekai type of story, which is not necessary that bad.- The game design is so generic, pokemon always had a charismatic look and i don't see nothing about it in this game. The trees, the towns and buildings, etc. just looks like a generic f2p chinese game, I expect more from Pokemon Company. The map looks pretty damn good though. Even the music is generic.- The new roster of pokemons from Hisui, despite Arcanine, are way worse designed than their original forms. And Arcanine it's not that he's better, just feels different.- No online PVP. The stats from the pokemon are no longer needed, and thats pitty.- Let's finish with the more obvious of all of them, the game looks really bad, not only talking about the graphics, which are way below from the standard of the Switch console. I'll not compare it with BOTW (a game lauched 4years ago) but if you do a massive open world, it's important that the ambientation and the world itself works as a hole, in order to get inmersed in it.",30-Jan-22,3,0.128205128,38,55,7.2

Only another village and yet nothing worthwhile to the storyline to do there.As other critics have mentioned, the NPCs are also blatantly empty.To me the only worthwhile point to this game is the storyline and even there they could've cut to the chase at the end instead of adding double and triple plot twists!Completed the game and tossed it in my completed game section.

891,"Pokemon Legends was an extreme disappointment for me. I was super hyped for this game as a lifelong Pokemon fan, but also as an RPG fan. This game fell short of my expectations in several different categories.Firstly, the combat feels horrible to me. They revamped the stats and combat system for Pokemon Legends, but it doesn't feel good. Every move hits so hard, and you will often lose several Pokemon battling a wild Pokemon. You will almost always lose a few when fighting an Alpha Pokemon or a Noble Pokemon. A lot of people seem to think this makes the game more challenging, but to me it just made it more frustrating. I still never blacked out or lost my entire party, I just had to craft a boatload of revives and potions after each fight.In addition to this, they removed abilities from the game and instead added ""Agile"" and ""Strong"" style moves. You can use agile to perform and weaker attack, or strong for the opposite. While this seems cool in theory, battles rarely ever last long enough to reward using agile style. I personally feel like abilities made Pokemon more unique and provided for a more interesting combat experience. Overall, I tried to avoid encounters with wild Pokemon and catch them without entering combat if possible.Secondly, the story blows. One of the main appeals to most RPGs is their stories. The Witcher, Skyrim, Horizon Zero Dawn, etc. all have deep stories with plenty of twists and turns that keep you engaged. The story in Pokemon Legends is extremely vague and offers very little conclusion even upon full completion. You're basically a kid who fell through a space-time distortion into ancient Sinnoh where Pokemon are going crazy. Upon completion of the story and the entire Pokedex, you still haven't figured out who you are and why you fell through the space-time rift to begin with.Third, calling this an ""open-world RPG"" is laughable. The game is extremely linear and you are bound to certain areas until you complete the main quest. This isn't like Skyrim, Fallout, or Breath of the Wild where you can freely go where you please and complete the story how you like. There are no meaningful choices involved at all. You can explore the areas you've unlocked to your heart's content, but there aren't really any side stories or anything. The world is bland and lacks depth. There aren't any cool puzzles or hidden areas to discover. Ultimately, this just felt like a different take on the existing Pokemon games. It certainly didn't feel like the revolutionary open-world RPG that it was hyped up to be.Lastly, I tried not to judge this game too harshly off of graphics and performance, but unfortunately, it is impossible to overlook that aspect of the game. This game plays and looks worse than Skyrim, a 2011 game. There are FPS drops that make the game laggy and feel bad regardless of whether you play handheld or docked. I know the Switch isn't a very powerful system, but it sure ran Breath of the Wild a heck of a lot better.Overalll, I think Pokemon Legends is a cool idea with awful execution. While it was enjoyable at times (especially in the beginning) doing the same thing over and over got old pretty fast. This game feels close to being something awesome but falls short in way too many crucial areas for me to warrant giving it more than a 3 or a 4 at best. Unfortunately, due to the shockingly good reviews this game has gotten so far, I don't think Game Freak or TPC will make efforts to improve on these areas in the future, and Pokemon will continue to go downhill as a franchise.",06-Feb-22,3,0.571428571,1,1,0

893,"It's fun in the short term, but it doesn't have much in the way of replayability, or even story despite the fact that it's supposed to be narrative driven. Most of the game is catching PokÃ©mon until it's time for you to do the same repetitive task of calming the angry lord PokÃ©mon. PokÃ©mon is no stranger to repetition, but it's less challenging than the PokÃ©mon Gyms in previous games. Those at least had a few trainers each, different puzzles to solve, and Gym Leaders weren't hard to beat, but if you weren't prepared you could lose or just barely win. The lord PokÃ©mon are much easier to beat than Gym Leaders, and it's a much more tedious task. You just throw balm, battle, throw balm, battle again, and throw balms. Or you can skip the battles completely and just throw balms. Even Dialga and Palkia can be cheesed by just throwing balms, and they're some of the final bosses of the game. There's a huge lack of trainer battles in the game. You're lucky to see one every half hour. I'd say it's closer to one an hour unless you're at the few segments in the game where you're forced into back to back battles. There's no post game facility like virtually every other main series game after Crystal, and there are about 240 PokÃ©mon, so very few to choose from in regards to team building. On subsequent playthroughs if you can actually bring yourself to replay the game you'll likely end up using the same PokÃ©mon because there are so few encountered in the first 5 or so areas. There are a decent number of side quests (or ""Requests"" as the game calls them to differentiate from the main quests or ""Missions""), but most of them are simple fetch quests. Bring an NPC x number of y item(s), show them a certain PokÃ©mon or PokÃ©dex entry, etc. and there's virtually no multiplayer besides trading, despite every other main series game having player vs player battles which never detracted from the single player experience. The world is also full of barren fields or mountains that have maybe 2 or 3 PokÃ©mon on screen at best 99% of the time, which is inexcusable because the areas are relatively small compared to other open world games (I'm using that term loosely for this game). Other games of this nature you'll find settlements or structures with characters who will give you quests or you can explore a dungeon. No such luck here, you'll just keep walking seeing the same PokÃ©mon and plants over and over again.The game is mediocre at best, bad but not terrible at worst. I know bad games, because I've played the Two Worlds games and Sonic '06.I really wanted to like the game and hoped it would be good, but I was thoroughly let down. PokÃ©mon Sword and Shield and PokÃ©mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are miles ahead of this game in terms of content, replayability, and following the concept of the series as a whole.",29-Jan-22,3,0.125,3,3,0

902,"Pokemon Legends: Arceus is more of a tech demo that experiences with new mechanics and quality of life features for the pokemon franchise than it is a fully fledged AAA title.PLA's main draw is that it attempts to shakeup the pokemon formula by modernizing the pokemon experience to more closely match what pokemon catching would be like in the real world and how it is depicted in the anime series.There is clearly some effort put forth here in executing this new formula, but just like almost every other recent iteration of pokemon, there are obvious signs of neglect and corner cutting.The most obvious signs of neglect come from its lackluster visuals. Graphics aren't everything sure, but in a semi-open world game where exploring the environment and catching pokemon is the main draw, how the world looks is an important aspect of the overall experience.Not only are the graphics sub par when compared to other titles on the same console, it doesn't even match the graphical quality of games from 5+ years ago.Now, if sub-par graphics are used to make up for hinderances due to performance that can be more understandable but that is not the case here.PLA has much less taking place on screen at any given time than many other open world games and it's also not technically an open world game as each individual area you explore is a restricted sub-set of the overall world based on what mission/objective is chosen from the ""Town Hub"" which is also the only town you'll be visiting.Given the restrictive nature of the ""open world"" and its sub-par graphics, it could still look better if simply more was taking place on screen. For example, if there were more trees, more grass, more pokemon, etc. even if the textures looked the way they do, there would be better immersion overall.Instead, we get poor graphics, a limited world, and barren empty environments. All of that being said, this unfortunately doesn't equate to better performance. The game still suffers from performance issues and pop-in.Aside from visuals and performance, the game itself has a repetitive gameplay loop.There are no dungeons in PLA, no real puzzles, no interesting caves, there are pokemon and there are more pokemon and your only job is to throw balls at them and/or fight them.Not having IVs/EVs, breeding, competitive battling, held items etc. removes a huge aspect of replay-ability and purpose from the game.Not having any interesting, nice-looking environments to explore, no puzzles, and no real challenges aside from making your character roll to the side make this overall experience very lack luster.Some would probably say that only ""hardcore pokemon fans"" would like this game but I disagree. I think there are plenty of hardcore pokemon fans who simply recognize this games flaws and are able to acknowledge this is not the definitive edition of pokemon or what we all wanted.If you like simply catching pokemon, reading lots of dialogue, exploring empty worlds, not having any real motivation or purpose aside from completing checklists, then you'll likely enjoy this game.For everyone else, you're going to be disappointed. I would assume though that the majority of the more critical gamers and pokemon fans already know this.I give GameFreak credit for trying something new but this is not the kind of pokemon experience I ultimately wanted. It's scratching the surface, it's getting there so to speak, but it's still lacking a lot of charm and polish.Given that this game has, I believe, only been developed for roughly a year or so, what they've managed to achieve in that time isn't bad necessarily but to call this a AAA Nintendo Switch title and to charge full price for it is disappointing.Again, if going back on the visuals and limiting the explorable world to small sub-sets at a time were for performance reasons, they didn't achieve their goal.The world is a bland, uneventful, empty, barren place. There are pokemon in it so, there's that but after you hide in a bush a few times, dodge roll some attacks, and throw a few pokeballs around, you've literally experienced the entirety of this game.There is a story sure, but it's somewhat irrelevant and is largely just tedious and not immersive enough given the state the rest of the game is in.Now maybe GameFreak will be able to use this ""Tech Demo"" as a starting point to create future titles and maybe in doing so we can expect/hope for more polish in the future but the point here is that PLA doesn't really add all that much to the pokemon franchise and the overall experience it offers is very lackluster and generic.I think part of the reason PLA is getting as much praise as it has is due to the fact that pokemon fans are literally starving for innovation. Coming from the 1:1 remake that is Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, it makes PLA look revolutionary.Dodge rolling and open world exploration are not new ideas.",02-Feb-22,3,0.444444444,1,2,0
903,"It's interesting and good that Gamefreak finally decided to innovate, but the world is dead and looks very ugly. Art style of the world doesn't match that of the characters, buildings and Pokemon. Whose bright idea was it to create a realistic looking ground and grass with cartoon characters filled in the world? Makes no sense. Art direction is horrible. Want more evidence? Unity free asset store water.World is empty, nothing happens in it. It used to be that Open World games carried with them some feeling of prestige. There was always something to do in it and the worlds were filled to the brim with content. This game is the opposite and feels like a student project.

Also the company really don't know how encourage players by placing good fast-travel spots; like, there are no fast-travel before bosses or important battles, so you can't adjust team or select items right there and try again. So good luck running around the world again and again with the worst experience.On the other hand, the combat system is super screwed. The 3-on-1 is totally cheated...

Remember that breath of the wild was MADE FOR THE WII U, and think of how that looks...I'm sure part of it is them using the ancient engine they used for pokemon x/y and sun/moon on the 3DS, but they still have responsibility for making the choice to use an abysmal in-house engine.",03-Feb-22,2,0.4,4,10,1.3

No good, just no good. It makes my mind hurt seeing so many ?critics??(aka YouTubers who are afraid of losing their access to early copies / brainwashed super-fans / bribed corrupt gaming media outlets) rating this game so highly. It sucks! I?m not even going to focus on the graphics but if you think they are acceptable in any way, you have no standards in life. This is a console that runs The Witcher 3. BOTW comparisons really hold merit in this department.The gameplay though, blimey??I just can?t fathom how fans are satisfied with this janky mess of gameplay. It?s like one giant wild area from SW/SH in terms of being empty and devoid of any interest except for the PokÃ©mon themselves. The battles have a new gimmick that barely matters or is completely broken. It?s the same rock, paper, scissors fare with crap animations.The story is absolute garbage. Surely there has to be a point where even the young kids that seemingly seem to be the audience that holds this series back, get sick of the narratives that they trot out. In 2022 we still have characters just stand there and wave their hands like characters from a 20+ year old Ps2 JRPG exposing about nonsense whilst everyone stands around awkwardly. No one has cared about a PokÃ©mon story for decades, why is there soooo much talking in this game. I can tell you why, to pad it out and make it long. Boss battles are lame. Who thought throwing infinite magic food bags was an inspired choice? That plus half baked dark souls roll dodging, yuck.If you?re a player who really, really likes switching your brain off and completing a PokÃ©dex, I can see the appeal. But it?s just soooo bad??Awful graphics and frame rate, awful story, bland repetitive gameplay. If it didn?t have the PokÃ©mon label it would be laughed into oblivion.Why, just why, would you invest your time playing this game, and not amazing games like God of War or Disco Elysium, or heck if you?re a kid, BOTW or Mario Odyssey.

Everything is repetitive and it gets boring.World: the world is just boring, no mysteries & nothing to really explore. Besides this the graphics are awful. The citys are all just copy and paste and the pokemon in the world are acting like robots.Also is the game on the technical level like a N64 game (bad animations, bad rendering, ....)So lets sum it up: Pokemon is finally progressing but not nearly enough. This game would be okay for like 30$ but not as a full price title. Of course some players will have fun with the game and they like to just grind the same things over and over again but this game is far away from being good.

911,"Core gameplay loop is running from one resource node to the next while capturing each pokemon at least half a dozen times. Sometimes after stuffing their ass with berries first, sometimes after throwing ""balls of mud"", sometimes doing the same, but stealthily. I don't know who this appeals to, but it's not me. The zones are also void of any landmarks or points of interest, each zone is just a handful of vaguely different biomes littered with materials to gather and pokemon to catch - it's basically a few different wild area zones, and frankly the DLC wild areas in SWSH were more interesting than these. Different pokemon species behave like each other - you got hostile pokemon that seem to spot you from way further than you can even lock on tho them, you got skittish pokemon that run away and despawn when they spot you, and you got neutral pokemon that don't give a sh*t but that's the extent of variation in pokemon behavior. The ""boss fights"" are ridiculously easy, and the AI is so basic it can get itself stuck in level geometry. There is no way you'll get hit by the telegraphed attack patterns more than once. Side quests are mostly fetch quests. There are literal hours worth of dialogue, none of it voice acted. You'll probably mash B through most of it. Scaling through the story is a bit wonky, there isn't much of a reason to put effort into your team when whatever the next zone offers is usually stronger and higher level anyway. Or you could just bruteforce capture alphas and be way overpowered to anything you'll currently face.Battle mechanics have been heavily bastardized for this game. ATB turn order turn order means turns are no longer taken simultaneously, resulting in situations where you may find yourself in a unfavorable matchup against a much faster pokemon, and you don't even get the chance to switch out before the enemy takes one - or more turns. The game is missing like 70%+ of moves, and the remaining moves have been simplified to fit the battle system. The list of missing battle features continues, there are no: priority moves, abilities, held items, weather control, terrain, hazards, speed control, multitarget moves and more. Moves that alter attack or defense now affect both physical and special, stat changes are now limited to a single stage, and they only last for a few turns which is an odd change for sure. Status can also now be overridden by another. There are no pvp battles, but you wouldn't want them with these battle mechanics anyway.There are some good quality of life changes, like the ability to swap out learned moves on the go, instead of having to visit the move reminder. On the other hand we have lost mobile access to PC, and we can't fast travel between zones. First you must return to base camp, load into town, leave the gates again, load into the zone and then move to your location - because just flying directly to any point of interest like in any other pokemon game would have been way too convenient.The game is pretty poor looking on a technical level, and the artstyle is inconsistent which is a shame, if the game stuck to the artstyle it could have looked decent. Soundscape is also pretty barren and the sparse use of background music doesn't help to hide it.PLA is different, I can respect that. But it's also in a lot of ways just straight up worse than previous pokemon games and it doesn't stand on its own as a openworld-esque rpg either. If you want to observe pokemon, play snap. If you want to battle pokemon, play SWSH. If you want a open world RPG, play BotW. PLA has some aspects of them all, but does it very poorly.",03-Feb-22,2,0.428571429,2,2,0

It hides itself under the veil of being open world, but in reality it's nothing more than a series of blocked entries and constant hand-holding set in a large map. Hell, it's not even possible to get out of the main village; you hit an invisible wall. You have to warp, with the map, to another point to change areas.

Ich erwarte von einer Millionen Franchise Marke wie Pokemon mehr als nur eine mehr schlecht als rechte Kopie von Monster Hunter Rise Elementen. Das Spiel hat eine Unterirdische Grafik und selbst fÃ¼r die Leistungsschwache Switch ist das nicht ok, siehe MH, BotW, Xenoblade chronicle etc. Ich verstehe auch nicht wie der Gameplayloop Spass macht, denn es besteht eigentlich nur aus Rollen und Ball werfen + manchmal etwas KÃ¤mpfen auf nem sehr einfachen Schwierigkeitsgrad. Dieses Pokemon hat einfach alles Wegrazionalisiert, was Pokemon ausmacht. Es gibt kein PVP, nur eine Handvoll Trainer kÃ¤mpfen, keine Ligen oder wirklichen Challenges, keinen richtigen Plot (hatte Pokemon nie aber man hier ist die Story echt flach) usw. Die Gelbcolorierten Boss Pokemon muss man auch nicht bekÃ¤mpfen, es reicht zu Rollen und dem Vieh ein SÃ¤ckchen an die Birne zu werfen dabei wirkt es nicht sehr fordernd.Das Spiel bietet eigentlich nichts ausser Grind, da du x-mal dieses Pokemon fangen musst, x-Beeren geben sollst und x-mal dieses Pokemon Person A-Z zeigen sollst. Die hohen Wertungen, kann ich nur verstehen, wenn sie von Casual Spielern kommen, welche leider ausser den Mobilegames keine wirkliche Gaming Erfahrung besitzen. Ich sage nicht das Spiel kann einem nicht Spass machen aber fÃ¼r mich jedenfalls ist dieser ewige Grind und die Wiederholenden Aufgaben mit der minimalistischen Grafik und der etwa 20h beschÃ¤ftigungs Foltertherapie nichts.Positiv: - Was neues probiertNegativ: - Freche MH Rise Kopie von Mechaniken (Map mit Biomen, Quest Dorf, crafting, etc) in viel schlechter- Unterirdische Grafik- Wiederholender langweiliger Loop und Grind- keine Voice Ausgabe in 2022 (Das wÃ¤re doch mal ein Fortschritt)- Nur etwas mehr als 200 Pokemon- Keine guten Funktionen aus Ã¤lteren Teilen Ã¼bernommen (Mega Entwicklung, Schwierigkeitsgrad, Pvp etc)- Reduktion der Attackenmovesets auf ein Mimimum- Kein Multiplayer- Framerate einbrÃ¼che aus der HÃ¶hle- Wird sich verkaufen wie heisse Schokolade weil halt Pokemon drauf stehtFazit: Hiesse dieses Spiel nicht Pokemon, dann wÃ¼rde es wohl als schlechter Monster Hunter Rise Wannabe Klon abgestempelt werden.

Trailers hyped a lot of people by showing new refreshing battle mechanics, making it look like it was going to be more than just moving the stick and pressing the A button ... That before seing the reality. Once again, you are limited to a pretty repetitive turn based combat, and once again, I can see why people actually defend this because that is something that... Well, has been in PokÃ©mon games since the very beginning, but I think I can speak for a lot of players when I say I would have liked to see and play with a different battle style.Graphic-wise this is mediocre. I can't see why people actually say it doesn't matter or actually say it is Nintendo's hardware fault, just take a look at BOTW, or some pretty heavy ports like Doom, Doom Eternal, The Witcher 3. Seeing forests with the bare minimung account of trees is disappointing, and it affects immersion. Some areas look plain, with almost no PokÃ©mon to be seen until they pop out of nowhere. And no, I don't say this game needed Ray-Tracing or 4K textures, but as I said, just taking BOTW, that game looks much more solid in graphics.Once again, Gamefreak reuses 3Ds' PokÃ©mon models, those that have come all the way from XY, and now they can't justify it AGAIN saying they wanted to make PokÃ©mon look ""better"", because they are lacking animations in the world asides from walking, swimming or moving the 3D model with no additional animations from the ground to a tree... That until the PokÃ©mon disappears. This game has less PokÃ©mon than Sword / Shield, and that is shameful.This was the perfect game to add voice acting, and I can't see why they can't do it, it could save immersion, make the game more enjoyable and actually help convey the emotions of the characters, but once again, they didn't, making the game feel plain, literally wasting somewhat of a decent story the game is trying to tell. A lot of games, even f2p games have high quality voice acting.Nintendo Switch has shown to be capable of more than this stuttery mess. And I can't believe this game took ALL of Gamefreak's attention, making BDSP as bad as they are.

925,"I honestly really disliked legends of Arceus, and I think i'm just done with mainline PokÃ©mon for a while. Aside from the technical issues that we all knew would be coming, the game just isn't fun. The catching got really boring for me after a while. The weaker mons just went in and it felt like a chore to battle everything else. At some point it felt like ""why am I just fighting these PokÃ©mon, there's no reason my ultra or great balls shouldn't just be able to deal with this"", which left me wondering why i was bothering to even engage in the dex.The game is also horribly unbalanced. With your ability to catch alpha PokÃ©mon, if you catch one then you basically sweep till the next power up, then you sweep again. Rinse and repeat. The alpha PokÃ©mon are so far ahead of everybody and everyone else it makes the game a massive breeze. Sure you can self inflict rules to not catch them, but honestly, it shouldn't have even been an option. The mons offer good enough rewards defeating them, they should have been uncatchable mini bosses.The pokedex honestly feels like padding. I'm glad its more involved, don't get me wrong, its an improvement, but the option to go further than research level 10 is nothing more than an excuse to get you to play the game more, it doesn't offer anything substantial and nothing you can't get going well below research level 10 on every PokÃ©mon in a given zone. Now instead of simply completing the dex, the player for true completion must watch a magicarp use splash 100 times, watch the tackle, ember, fire wheel, and almost every other move's animation dozens if not hundreds of times. You must catch every PokÃ©mon a minimum of 15-25 times, for many more because you need to catch them while they're unaware of you, watch PokÃ©mon eat food who knows how many times, beat PokÃ©mon with a certain type of move a ton of times (which adds to the problem of seeing repeated animations) and this is far worse than other PokÃ©mon games because you can't disable battle animations, and its required to beat the game.The world is probably the worst part of the game. I'm not talking about the look (although I also dislike the art style), but the actual play world is just bad. Its so empty. There is nothing to do in each zone other than catch PokÃ©mon. Nothing to look at other than Mt. Coronet, nothing in the world to interact with that's fun. There should be more to do than resource gather or catch, I want to have fun things to do while I'm engaging in the main game. It feels like a parred down version of what it could and honestly should be. Every zone feels the same. While yes, one zone is swampy, another is cold, and one is the sea, they feel the same to explore. The only reason I remember differences between the zones is because Its so fresh in my mind. In a few months its going to all blend together. If I recall correctly, there was a pathway in the first zone that went up and to the left (might have been the 3rd), and that reappeared in the snowy zone. Not a pathway going up and to the left, the exact same pathway. It had the same side, same slope, same geometry, same everything.The art also looks bad. I don't mean graphically, I don't care how it looks graphically, I mean the art style. The game is bland, boring, and really uninspired. Its clear they were trying for ancient Japanese art, but it doesn't translate to the game at all. Compared to other games on the swtich with more inventive art styles, and other PokÃ©mon games like unite or xd tournament, the game just feels like a smear of brown with some green and blue mixed in. The fan made stuff looks better than the actual game. I honestly think it should have looked like the end of the reveal trailer, that would have been fantastic.The characters are all also super bland. Its the same issue with the zones, in a few months, they're going to blend together again. I'm not expecting a story or characters in PokÃ©mon akin to xenoblade, but I am expecting something more, especially since this PokÃ©mon game is the most story and character driven game since gen 5. I can honestly say I will remember gen 6 characters better than these ones, and its because they had distinctive designs.The game did improve on the PC (mass release), moves, seeing the true size of PokÃ©mon on the overworld, and evolutions, I think all of those should stay. I like those.I also enjoyed the boss fights. The main draw for me was interacting with PokÃ©mon in the overworld, and they were a fun way of doing that while also showing the destructive might of PokÃ©mon, and showing how truly dangerous they were.The final thing I really enjoyed was the time the game was set in, learning about PokÃ©mon with everyone else, and watching as people are afraid because of how little they understand about PokÃ©mon is a really fun thing to experience, I just wish the rest of the game was as good as that.",31-Jan-22,2,0.25,1,1,0

928,"The absolute minimum. A review.With Pokemon Legends: Arceus, Gamefreak has created a game, that is on the one hand loved and praised to heavens and on the other hand, objektively critisesed to bare bones. But how is this even possible? Wouldn't a really good game be critisesed only by haters without any foundational and objektive reasoning?Pokemon Legends: Arceus tries to be and is very different from your classic Pokemon game. The changes in gameplay are refreshing and it's clear, that Gamefreak finally pushes Pokemon to new grounds. The gameplay is very different and very pleasing. You can through a Pokeball to a Pokemon and catch it WHILE you are already on your way to a tree with fruits on it. And you trough a ball to the tree and your Pokemon collects the fruits. Then you have different maps where you go to do quests, like in the Monster Hunter games. This concept on it's own is very nice and can be quite adicting.The story is also quite interesting. You get to know the beginning of the Sinnoh area, where only settlers exist and cities are yet to build.However, this where the negatives come in...1. Grafics/Artstyle/Tech: High and grafics are by all means no necessity. But what Gamefreak delivered here, is a disgrace. A punch into the gamers face and eyes. The world is empty, there literally are 3-4 types of different tree designes that where just copy pasted like in a map editor. The textures are muddy, low res, edgy, polygonal. Some designes unironically look like they copied them from an N64 game (trees). Look at the god damn lava! Like they didn't allow the designers, to give it texture and make it look like actual lava and not pumpkin soup.60 FPS are also no requirement for a game. But somewhat stable 30 FPS like in breath of the wild, Xenoblade Chronicles games or Monster Hunter Rise should be the expectable. ESPECIALLY from a BILLION Dollar company, that owns the biggest and most successfull franchise of all time. The framerate constantly is below 30 and in some areas the lags are maddening... Breath of the wild on the WiiU was smooth as **** in comparison. It baffles my mind how reviews credit the game to be ""technically faultless"".2. Pokemon and Charcters: From a game, that want's you to explore a world full of animals (Pokemon), that want's you to study them and build the pokedex, you could expect, that they interact with each other or have some kind of behaviour. But no. Nothing. The Pokemon just stand there and go from point A to point B, without a reason. The don't yawn, scratch their ears, scream at ech other, play around, eat grass/fruits/insects, smell etc. There is no Evoli cuddling with another, or Starly building a nest. They are lifeless creatures. They could very well scarecrows that are mechanically moved between point A and B.The Characters in this game have like no gestures. The head looks like a robot when the look from one person to another, eyes don't seem to moved at all apart from the eyelids. And in centuries of RPG developement, earning billions and billions of USD, Pokemon has still no voice acting (s if they wouldn't have an Anime where they could borrow actors from. FOR THEIR OWN FRANCHSIE).Also... why the hell can't we fly UPWARDS?3. Quests and Progression: The quests... repetitive, boring and uninspired. It's like Gamefreak thought of a way to artificially increase the length of the game. They send you from point A to point B to talk to someone, just to be sent back to point A. And this feels like, they want you to spend time with walking around between speechbubbles, because they just haven't thought of enough content.All in all, the game is obviously rushed and needed at least a year if not two, to really be worth a full prized AAA game, from probably the most wealthy gaming company in the world. Every other independent devstudio could have done game that looks appealing to the eye, implement animations to pokemon and characters, think of actual quests and a better way to fill the pokedex (kill or catch 25 of this pokemon to get the pokedexentry). This game, didn't even try to be good to make money, because the pokemon company knew from the very beginning, that it will print them millions and millions of lovely, fresh and green USD. They didn't even try to hide tha fact, that they didn't spend much money on the development, with good visuals, like EA does.Pokemon Legends: Arceus is the result of a company who only want's our money, because they already have built up their reputation with the first 6 generations of Pokemon games, the anime and merchandise. They know that they only have to do one thing, to be able to make more money with Pokemon TM : The absolute minimum (and even less than that).",04-Feb-22,2,0.444444444,2,5,8.2
929,"This game is such a let-down, so much so that I submit my first review to metacritic.I will say, I've loved pokemon since red/blue and even though this is a step in the right direction I am not going to congratulate them for innovating 15 years too late.TLDR: Grindy, not great-looking, handholdy fetch quest that is detached from the idea of you caring for the pokemon you catch - the game.I'll assume the game starts at a score of 10 and we can see how it progresses shall we?Firstly the game puts you on rails for 2 HOURS in an unskippable tutorial that starts and stops every 5 second to do another cutscene. And you can't turn off the waypoint marker, cause you know, who likes exploration and figuring things out? (-2 points)The grind is unbelievable and it requires you to grind to grind endlessly to progress between areas - so an arbitrary grind-gate instead of a challenge you have to overcome. If that wasn't bad enough they've somehow gotten the idea that catching 1000 identical pokemon is exciting and wholesome, it's not and never will be. (-3 points)Boss battles are all the same, using some weird TPS system where you throw bags at them, and have to dodge just at the right time, so now we're skipping pokemon battles entirely? (-1 point)Dialogues have non-options until you choose the ""right"" option. If there is only 1 option don't pretend like I have 2 (-1 point)The world feels and looks plastic-like. This is an nintendo-only developer that has access to reach out to BOTW team, there is no excuse to look this shoddy. Furthermore traversal in the environment is quickly eliminated with uncontextual fast-travel and a steed that rides the entire map where-ever you are in < 1min. ( -1 point)Everything you do in the game is a fetch quest, which as per my last point is trivialized.

The world is absolute emptiness, there's nothing to do besides the main mechanic of the game, throwing balls. An entire premise of an hostile world and how humans started to get along with pokemon thrown onto the ground and spit on because of lazyness. I can't believe how its worldbuilding makes absolute nonsense while being so basic and poor. Inside the little thing they did, they did wrong. It's formidable.I don't give it a 0 because the HUD is fine and captures in real time, aswell being able to move while being in battle are fun and a good integration in PokÃ©mon games.

It is a much wider scale game with little to do. The general gist of the game is to catch and collect all the pokemon of a region before moving on to the next to repeat it again. It becomes repetitve very quickly and stops being enjoyable after a few hours. The lack of variety in its creatures really kills the momentum the first few hours of free roaming gives you, not to mention its better by its own standards story. The npcs seem more fleshed out than evr but the series from the very beginning has had a low standard. And thats what bothers me the most, i wouldn't be laud a developer for doing the bare minimum lesser developers do every time they release a new game. They took a step in the right direction, dont get me wrong. But to veer from their own formulaic games just to give us a barebones look of what pokemon should have been when it came to console just drives the point home that the series has gone on a downward spiral for quite some time. This reeks of a demo of qhat they could be capable of if they actually tried.

The greedy developers are charging $60 for a game that looks like it was made for mobiles. It doesn't even have the AAA quality to justify the $60 price tag. The graphics are a joke. The textures are garbage. When I look at some of the rock textures, it literally looks like it was ported from a Game Cube game. That is embarrassing for a 2022 $60 game.The animations are garbage. The running animations are cringeworthy. The rain effects look laughable. There is nothing to do in the open world. Just an empty world full of plants, rocks and empty hills. That is so boring to explore. For goodness sake, why doesn't this video game series still have any voice acting? Unbelievable that there are still $60 games with no voice acting in 2022. The developers are too cheap to pay for voice actors. This outrageous greed makes EA and Rockstar look like saints in comparison. At least they put voice acting in their $60 games. Speaking of voice acting, the voice acting of the animals sound like they were done by the developers themselves, in a pathetic attempt at keeping the budget low for this game. The physics are beyond horrible, especially the water physics. The story is trash. The combat is boring and repetitive. When I pay $60, I expect a combat system with depth and detail. All the developers did in this game is put pretty lights during every move, to give players the illusion that the game is fun. None of that is fun for me. The soundtrack is terrible.There is no multiplayer. So once you beat the story, there is not a reason to touch this game again. Charging $60 for a game with no replay value is a cash grab.

1048,"A great idea executed poorly, with so many other gorgeous games avaliable on the switch it stands to reason a game by Gamefreak should look at least similar. Instead it barely hides its stuttering fps issues and subpar graphics with the collecting of pokemon its had throughout its series. The new gameplay is stunted by the glaring issues the game has at its foundation. The fundamental flaw is lack of variety, when all is said and done there is no replayability to this game after finishing the pokedex. There is no multiplayer battles, no rebattling trainers, no new pokemon after completing the regional dex, no breeding mechanics and no other goals left. Ehat you have left is a barren world rife with monsters youve already have caught over and over. Which brings me back to the flaw of lack of variety, a measly 242 pokemon to catch with the small amount of actual battles you get to experience reduces your options for actually USING your pokemon to only a few instances, you will be seeing your mounts more than you will ever see your own pokemon in battle. Another aspect that i find irritating is the amount of design taken straight from breath of the wild, from its menu options to its game hud it ends up emulating a much better game as if to remind you you could be playing THAT instead. It tries so hard to be something it wasn't to begin with and then trips over itself in presentation.",02-Feb-22,0,0.428571429,1,1,0

I've seen playstation 2 games with better graphics and hardware is not the problem, look at BotW and Xenoblade and Monster Hunter on the switch WAY better and on the same system.

1051,"Es lamentable que una de las franquicias que mÃ¡s dinero genera saque a la venta un juego asÃ­. Es inadmisible que solo por ser PokÃ©mon haya que conformarse con un juego mediocre que no aporta nada mÃ¡s allÃ¡ de un estilo de juego a lo Monster Hunter , que no es realmente un mundo abierto y no estÃ¡n inventando nada que no haya ya , sacrificando un apartado grÃ¡fico, lleno de popping, bugs y que es peor que el de Wii, un apartado sonoro repetitivo e inexistente en algunos casos . La historia flojita con unos diÃ¡logos que no llevan a ninguna parte puesto que la elecciÃ³n del diÃ¡logo es una falsa ilusiÃ³n, con personajes inexpresivos y sin gancho. Un juego con poca dificultad y mucho texto, cuyo mundo abierto, resulta vacÃ­o con un pueblo lleno de casas copiadas y pegadas, la innovaciÃ³n en el sistema de juego estÃ¡ bien pero no sacrificando todo lo demÃ¡s .El juego es disfrutable, y si es el camino que van a seguir los prÃ³ximos juegos de PokÃ©mon estarÃ¡ bien siempre y cuando no repitan los errores de este, grÃ¡ficos, diÃ¡logo, dificultad, etc.Es un Ã©xito solo porque los fans de PokÃ©mon nos conformamos con cualquier basura. Y no deberÃ­a ser asÃ­, desde el punto de vista de consumidor deberÃ­amos exigir mÃ¡s. It is unfortunate that one of the franchises that generates the most money releases such a game. It is inadmissible that just because it is a PokÃ©mon you have to settle for a mediocre game that does not contribute anything beyond a Monster Hunter-style game, which is not really an open world and they are not inventing anything that does not already exist, sacrificing a section graphic, full of popping, bugs and what is worse than the Wii, a repetitive and non-existent sound section in some cases. The weak story with dialogues that lead nowhere since the choice of dialogue is a false illusion, with inexpressive characters and without a hook. A game with little difficulty and a lot of text, whose open world is empty with a town full of copied and pasted houses, the innovation in the game system is fine but not sacrificing everything else. The game is enjoyable, and if it is the path that the next PokÃ©mon games are going to follow, it will be fine as long as they do not repeat the errors of this one, graphics, dialogue, difficulty, etc. It's a success only because PokÃ©mon fans settle for any garbage. And it shouldn't be like that, from the point of view of the consumer we should demand more.",04-Feb-22,0,0.454545455,1,1,0
1052,"Always trying to make something completely different and sell it by the name they put on it let's break it down if you change everything about something can you still call it the same thing let's say I artificially produce an orange when you see it it looks like an orange but as you begin to peel it you notice that it's green on the inside and instead of being juicy and squishy it's crisp like an apple and taste like a jalapeno, so you assumed it was an orange by the surface without delving deeper in and creating an opinion so now I ask how many of you would still call this monstrosity an orange because I certainly would not.
